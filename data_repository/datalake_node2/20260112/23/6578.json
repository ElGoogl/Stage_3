INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\r\ntrademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\r\nproviding copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in\r\naccordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the\r\nproduction, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™\r\nelectronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,\r\nincluding legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of\r\nthe following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this\r\nor any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or\r\nadditions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any\r\nDefect you cause.\r\n\r\nSection 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.",

C, which is not\r\nenchanting. It is several thousand miles. Again, if you will take the\r\npains to run your glance, no doubt discerning, over the police-blotter\r\nat the court (and frankly, I refuse to tell you the exact date of this\r\nwhimsical adventure), you will note with even greater surprise that all\r\nthis hubbub was caused by no crime against the commonwealth of the\r\nRepublic or against the person of any of its conglomerate people. The\r\nblotter reads, in heavy simple fist, \"disorderly conduct,\" a phrase\r\nwhich is almost as embracing as the word diplomacy, or society, or\r\nrespectability.\r\n\r\nSo far as my knowledge goes, there is no such a person as James\r\nOsborne. If, by any unhappy chance, he _does_ exist, I trust that he\r\nwill pardon the civil law of Washington, my own measure of familiarity,\r\nand the questionable taste on the part of my hero--hero, because, from\r\nthe rise to the fall of the curtain, he occupies the center of the\r\nstage in this little comedy-drama, and because authors have yet to find\r\na happy synonym for the word. The name James Osborne was given for the\r\nsimple reason that it was the first that occurred to the culprit\u0027s\r\nmind, so desperate an effort did he make to hide his identity.\r\nSupposing, for the sake of an argument in his favor, supposing he had\r\nsaid John Smith or William Jones or John Brown? To this very day he\r\nwould have been hiring lawyers to extricate him from libel and\r\nfalse-representation suits. Besides, had he given any of these names,\r\nwould not that hound-like scent of the ever suspicious police have been\r\naroused?\r\n\r\nTo move round and round in the circle of commonplace, and then to pop\r\nout of it like a tailed comet! Such is the history of many a man\u0027s\r\nlife. I have a near friend who went away from town one fall, happy and\r\ncontented with his lot. And what do you suppose he found when he\r\nreturned home? He had been nominated for alderman. It is too early to\r\npredict the fate of this unhappy man. And what tools Fate uses with\r\nwhich to carve out her devious peculiar patterns! An Apache Indian,\r\nbesmeared with brilliant greases and smelling of the water that never\r\nfreezes, an understudy to Cupid? Fudge! you will say, or Pshaw! or\r\nwhatever slang phrase is handy and, prevalent at the moment you read\r\nand run.\r\n\r\nI personally warn you that this is a really-truly story, though I do\r\nnot undertake to force you to believe it; neither do I purvey many\r\ngrains of salt. If Truth went about her affairs laughing, how many more\r\npersons would turn and listen! For my part, I believe it all nonsense\r\nthe way artists have pictured Truth. The idea is pretty enough, but so\r\nfar as hitting things, it recalls the woman, the stone, and the hen. I\r\nam convinced that Truth goes about dressed in the dowdiest of clothes,\r\nwith black-lisle gloves worn at the fingers, and shoes run down in the\r\nheels, an exact portrait of one of Phil May\u0027s lydies. Thus it is that\r\nwe pass her by, for the artistic sense in every being is repelled at\r\nthe sight of a dowdy with weeping eyes and a nose that has been rubbed\r\ntill it is as red as a winter apple. Anyhow, if she _does_ go about in\r\nbeautiful nudity, she ought at least to clothe herself with smiles and\r\nlaughter. There are sorry enough things in the world as it is, without\r\na lachrymal, hypochondriacal Truth poking her face in everywhere.\r\n\r\nNot many months ago, while seated on the stone veranda in the rear of\r\nthe Metropolitan Club in Washington (I believe we were discussing the\r\nmerits of some very old product), I recounted some of the lighter\r\nchapters of this adventure.\r\n\r\n_\"Eempossible!\"_ murmured the Russian attache, just as if the matter\r\nhad not come under his notice semi-officially.\r\n\r\nI presume that this exclamation disclosed another side to diplomacy,\r\nwhich, stripped of its fine clothes, means dexterity in hiding secrets\r\nand in negotiating lies. When one diplomat believes what another says,\r\nit is time for the former\u0027s government to send him packing. However,\r\nthe Englishman at my right gazed smiling into his partly emptied glass\r\nand gently stirred the ice. I admire the English diplomat; he never\r\nwastes a lie. He is frugal and saving.\r\n\r\n\"But the newspapers!\" cried the journalist. \"They never ran a line; and\r\nan exploit like this would scarce have escaped them.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I remember rightly, it was reported in the regular police items of\r\nthe day,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Strange that the boys didn\u0027t look behind the scenes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don\u0027t know,\" remarked the congressman; \"lots of things happen of\r\nwhich you are all ignorant. The public mustn\u0027t know everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what\u0027s the hero\u0027s name?\" asked the journalist.\r\n\r\n\"That\u0027s a secret,\" I answered. \"Besides, when it comes to the bottom of\r\nthe matter, I had something to do with the suppressing of the police\r\nnews. In a case like this, suppression becomes a law not excelled by\r\nthat which governs self-preservation. My friend has a brother in the\r\nWar Department; and together we worked wonders.\"\r\n\r\n\"It\u0027s a jolly droll story, however you look at it,\" the Englishman\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, it had its tragic side; but that is even more than ever\r\na secret.\"\r\n\r\nThe Englishman looked at me sharply, even gravely; but the veranda is\r\nonly dimly illuminated at night, and his scrutiny went unrewarded.\r\n\r\n\"Eh, well!\" said the Russian; \"your philosopher has observed that all\r\nmankind loves a lover.\"\r\n\r\n\"As all womankind loves a love-story,\" the Englishman added. \"You ought\r\nto be very successful with the ladies,\"--turning to me.\r\n\r\n\"Not inordinately; but I shall not fail to repeat your epigram,\"--and I\r\nrose.\r\n\r\nMy watch told me that it was half after eight; and one does not receive\r\nevery day an invitation to a dinner-dance at the Chevy Chase Club.\r\n\r\nI dislike exceedingly to intrude my own personality into this\r\nnarrative, but as I was passively concerned, I do not see how I can\r\navoid it. Besides, being a public man, I am not wholly averse to\r\npublicity; first person, singular, perpendicular, as Thackeray had it,\r\nin type looks rather agreeable to the eye. And I rather believe that I\r\nhave a moral to point out and a parable to expound.\r\n\r\nMy appointment in Washington at that time was extraordinary; that is to\r\nsay, I was a member of one of those committees that are born frequently\r\nand suddenly in Washington, and which almost immediately after\r\nregistration in the vital statistics of national politics. I had been\r\nsent to Congress, a dazzling halo over my head, the pride and hope of\r\nmy little country town; I had been defeated for second term; had been\r\nrecommended to serve on the committee aforesaid; served with honor, got\r\nmy name in the great newspapers, and was sent back to Congress, where I\r\nam still to-day, waiting patiently for a discerning president and a\r\nvacancy in the legal department of the cabinet. That\u0027s about all I am\r\nwilling to say about myself.\r\n\r\nAs for this hero of mine, he was the handsomest, liveliest rascal you\r\nwould expect to meet in a day\u0027s ride. By handsome I do not mean perfect\r\nfeatures, red cheeks, Byronic eyes, and so forth. That style of beauty\r\nbelongs to the department of lady novelists. I mean that peculiar manly\r\nbeauty which attracts men almost as powerfully as it does women. For\r\nthe sake of a name I shall call him Warburton. His given name in actual\r\nlife is Robert. But I am afraid that nobody but his mother and one\r\nother woman ever called him Robert. The world at large dubbed him Bob,\r\nand such he will remain up to that day (and may it be many years\r\nhence!) when recourse will be had to Robert, because \"Bob\" would\r\ncertainly look very silly on a marble shaft.\r\n\r\nWhat a friendly sign is a nickname! It is always a good fellow who is\r\ncalled Bob or Bill, Jack or Jim, Tom, Dick or Harry. Even out of\r\nTheodore there comes a Teddy. I know in my own case the boys used to\r\ncall me Chuck, simply because I was named Charles. (I haven\u0027t the\r\nslightest doubt that I was named Charles because my good mother thought\r\nI looked something like Vandyke\u0027s _Charles I_, though at the time of my\r\nbaptism I wore no beard whatever.) And how I hated a boy with a\r\nhigh-sounding, unnicknamable given name!--with his round white collar\r\nand his long glossy curls! I dare say he hated the name, the collar,\r\nand the curls even more than I did. Whenever you run across a name\r\ncarded in this stilted fashion, \"A. Thingumy Soandso\", you may make up\r\nyour mind at once that the owner is ashamed of his first name and is\r\ntrying manfully to live it down and eventually forgive his parents.\r\n\r\nWarburton was graduated from West Point, ticketed to a desolate\r\nfrontier post, and would have worn out his existence there but for his\r\nguiding star, which was always making frantic efforts to bolt its\r\nestablished orbit. One day he was doing scout duty, perhaps half a mile\r\nin advance of the pay-train, as they called the picturesque caravan\r\nwhich, consisting of a canopied wagon and a small troop of cavalry in\r\ndingy blue, made progress across the desert-like plains of Arizona. The\r\ntroop was some ten miles from the post, and as there had been no sign\r\nof Red Eagle all that day, they concluded that the rumor of his being\r\non a drunken rampage with half a dozen braves was only a rumor.\r\nWarburton had just passed over a roll of earth, and for a moment the\r\npay-train had dropped out of sight. It was twilight; opalescent waves\r\nof heat rolled above the blistered sands. A pale yellow sky, like an\r\ninverted bowl rimmed with delicate blue and crimson hues, encompassed\r\nthe world. The bliss of solitude fell on him, and, being something of a\r\npoet, he rose to the stars. The smoke of his corncob pipe trailed\r\nlazily behind him. The horse under him was loping along easily.\r\nSuddenly the animal lifted his head, and his brown ears went forward.\r\n\r\nAt Warburton\u0027s left, some hundred yards distant, was a clump of osage\r\nbrush. Even as he looked, there came a puff of smoke, followed by the\r\nevil song of a bullet. My hero\u0027s hat was carried away. He wheeled, dug\r\nhis heels into his horse, and cut back over the trail. There came a\r\nsecond flash, a shock, and then a terrible pain in the calf of his left\r\nleg. He fell over the neck of his horse to escape the third bullet. He\r\ncould see the Apache as he stood out from behind the bush. Warburton\r\nyanked out his Colt and let fly. He heard a yell. It was very\r\ncomforting. That was all he remembered of the skirmish.\r\n\r\nFor five weeks he languished in the hospital. During that time he came\r\nto the conclusion that he had had enough of military life in the West.\r\nHe applied for his discharge, as the compulsory term of service was at\r\nan end. When his papers came he was able to get about with the aid of a\r\ncrutch. One morning his colonel entered his subaltern\u0027s bachelor\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn\u0027t you rather have a year\u0027s leave of absence, than quit\r\naltogether, Warburton?\"\r\n\r\n\"A year\u0027s leave of absence?\" cried the invalid, \"I am likely to get\r\nthat, I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you held a responsible position I dare say it would be difficult.\r\nAs it is, I may say that I can obtain it for you. It will be months\r\nbefore you can ride a horse with that leg.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you, Colonel Raleigh, but I think I\u0027ll resign. In fact, I have\r\nresigned.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can withdraw that, if you but say the word. I don\u0027t want to lose\r\nyou, lad. You\u0027re the only man around here who likes a joke as well as I\r\ndo. And you will have a company if you\u0027ll only stick to it a little\r\nlonger.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have decided, Colonel. I\u0027m sorry you feel like this about it. You\r\nsee, I have something like twenty-five thousand laid away. I want to\r\nsee at least five thousand dollars\u0027 worth of new scenery before I\r\nshuffle off this mortal coil. The scenery around here palls on me. My\r\nthroat and eyes are always full of sand. I am off to Europe. Some day,\r\nperhaps, the bee will buzz again; and when it does, I\u0027ll have you go\r\npersonally to the president.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you please, Warburton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides, Colonel, I have been reading Treasure Island again, and I\u0027ve\r\ngot the fever in my veins to hunt for adventure, even a treasure. It\u0027s\r\nin my blood to wander and do strange things, and here I\u0027ve been\r\nhampered all these years with routine. I shouldn\u0027t care if we had a\r\ngood fight once in a while. My poor old dad traveled around the world\r\nthree times, and I haven\u0027t seen anything of it but the maps.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead, then. Only, talking about Treasure Island, don\u0027t you and\r\nyour twenty-five thousand run into some old Long John Silver.\"\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027ll take care.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Robert packed up his kit and sailed away. Not many months\r\npassed ere he met his colonel again, and under rather embarrassing\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nINTRODUCES MY HEROINE\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me begin at the beginning. The boat had been two days out of\r\nSouthampton before the fog cleared away. On the afternoon of the third\r\nday, Warburton curled up in his steamer-chair and lazily viewed the\r\nblue October seas as they met and merged with the blue October skies. I\r\ndo not recollect the popular novel of that summer, but at any rate it\r\nlay flapping at the side of his chair, forgotten. It never entered my\r\nhero\u0027s mind that some poor devil of an author had sweated and labored\r\nwith infinite pains over every line, and paragraph, and page-labored\r\nwith all the care and love his heart and mind were capable of, to\r\nproduce this finished child of fancy; or that this same author, even at\r\nthis very moment, might be seated on the veranda of his beautiful\r\nsummer villa, figuring out royalties on the backs of stray envelopes.\r\nNo, he never thought of these things.\r\n\r\nWhat with the wind and the soft, ceaseless jar of the throbbing\r\nengines, half a dream hovered above his head, and touched him with a\r\ngentle, insistent caress. If you had passed by him this afternoon, and\r\nhad been anything of a mathematician who could straighten out\r\ngeometrical angles, you would have come close to his height had you\r\nstopped at five feet nine. Indeed, had you clipped off the heels of his\r\nlow shoes, you would have been exact. But all your nice calculations\r\nwould not have solved his weight. He was slender, but he was hard and\r\ncompact. These hard, slender fellows sometimes weigh more than your men\r\nof greater bulk. He tipped the scales at one hundred sixty-two, and he\r\nlooked twenty pounds less. He was twenty-eight; a casual glance at him,\r\nand you would have been willing to wager that the joy of casting his\r\nfirst vote was yet to be his.\r\n\r\nThe princess commands that I describe in detail the charms of this Army\r\nAdonis. Far be it that I should disobey so august a command, being, as\r\nI am, the prime minister in this her principality of Domestic Felicity.\r\nHer brother has never ceased to be among the first in her dear regard.\r\nHe possessed the merriest black eyes: his mother\u0027s eyes, as I, a boy,\r\nremember them. No matter how immobile his features might be, these eyes\r\nof his were ever ready for laughter. His nose was clean-cut and\r\nshapely. A phrenologist would have said that his head did not lack the\r\nbump of caution; but I know better. At present he wore a beard; so this\r\nis as large an inventory of his personal attractions as I am able to\r\ngive. When he shaves off his beard, I shall be pleased to add further\r\nparticulars. I often marvel that the women did not turn his head. They\r\nwere always sending him notes and invitations and cutting dances for\r\nhim. Perhaps his devil-may-care air had something to do with the\r\nenchantment. I have yet to see his equal as a horseman. He would have\r\nmade it interesting for that pair of milk-whites which our old friend,\r\nUlysses (or was it Diomedes?) had such ado about.\r\n\r\nEvery man has some vice or other, even if it is only being good.\r\nWarburton had perhaps two: poker and tobacco. He would get out of bed\r\nat any hour if some congenial spirit knocked at the door and whispered\r\nthat a little game was in progress, and that his money was needed to\r\nkeep it going. I dare say that you know all about these little games.\r\nBut what would you? What is a man to do in a country where you may buy\r\na whole village for ten dollars? Warburton seldom drank, and, like the\r\nauthor of this precious volume, only special vintages.\r\n\r\nAt this particular moment this hero of mine was going over the monotony\r\nof the old days in Arizona, the sand-deserts, the unlovely landscapes,\r\nthe dull routine, the indifferent skirmishes with cattle-men and\r\nIndians; the pagan bullet which had plowed through his leg. And now it\r\nwas all over; he had surrendered his straps; he was a private citizen,\r\nwith an income sufficient for his needs. It will go a long way,\r\nforty-five hundred a year, if one does not attempt to cover the\r\ndistance in a five-thousand motor-car; and he hated all locomotion that\r\nwas not horse-flesh.\r\n\r\nFor nine months he had been wandering over Europe, if not happy, at\r\nleast in a satisfied frame of mind. Four of these months had been\r\ndelightfully passed in Paris; and, as his nomad excursions had\r\ninvariably terminated in that queen of cities, I make Paris the\r\nstarting point of his somewhat remarkable adventures. Besides, it was\r\nin Paris that he first saw Her. And now, here he was at last,\r\nhomeward-bound. That phrase had a mighty pleasant sound; it was to the\r\near what honey is to the tongue. Still, he might yet have been in Paris\r\nbut for one thing: She was on board this very boat.\r\n\r\nSuddenly his eyes opened full wide, bright with eagerness.\r\n\r\n\"It is She!\" he murmured. He closed his eyes again, the hypocrite!\r\n\r\nPermit me to introduce you to my heroine. Mind you, she is not _my_\r\ncreation; only Heaven may produce her like, and but once. She is well\r\nworth turning around to gaze at. Indeed I know more than one fine\r\ngentleman who forgot the time of day, the important engagement, or the\r\ntrend of his thought, when she passed by.\r\n\r\nShe was coming forward, leaning against the wind and inclining to the\r\nuncertain roll of the ship. A gray raincoat fitted snugly the youthful\r\nrounded figure. Her hands were plunged into the pockets. You may be\r\nsure that Mr. Robert noted through his half-closed eyelids these\r\ninconsequent details. A tourist hat sat jauntily on the fine light\r\nbrown hair, that color which has no appropriate metaphor. (At least, I\r\nhave never found one, and I am _not_ in love with her and _never_ was.)\r\nWarburton has described to me her eyes, so I am positive that they were\r\nas heavenly blue as a rajah\u0027s sapphire. Her height is of no moment.\r\nWhat man ever troubled himself about the height of a woman, so long as\r\nhe wasn\u0027t undersized himself? What pleased Warburton was the exquisite\r\nskin. He was always happy with his comparisons, and particularly when\r\nhe likened her skin to the bloomy olive pallor of a young peach. The\r\nindependent stride was distinguishingly American. Ah, the charm of\r\nthese women who are my countrywomen! They come, they go, alone,\r\nunattended, courageous without being bold, self-reliant without being\r\nrude; inimitable. In what an amiable frame of mind Nature must have\r\nbeen on the day she cast these molds! But I proceed. The young woman\u0027s\r\nchin was tilted, and Warburton could tell by the dilated nostrils that\r\nshe was breathing in the gale with all the joy of living, filling her\r\nhealthy lungs with it as that rare daughter of the Cyprian Isle might\r\nhave done as she sprang that morn from the jeweled Mediterranean spray,\r\nthat beggar\u0027s brooch of Neptune\u0027s.\r\n\r\nWarburton\u0027s heart hadn\u0027t thrilled so since the day when he first donned\r\ncadet gray. There was scarce any room for her to pass between his chair\r\nand the rail; and this knowledge filled the rascal with exultation.\r\nNearer and nearer she came. He drew in his breath sharply as the corner\r\nof his foot-rest (aided by the sly wind) caught her raincoat.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon!\" he said, sitting up.\r\n\r\nShe quickly released her coat, smiled faintly, and passed on.\r\n\r\nSometimes the most lasting impressions are those which are printed most\r\nlightly on the memory. Mr. Robert says that he never will forget that\r\nfirst smile. And he didn\u0027t even know her name then.\r\n\r\nI was about to engage your attention with a description of the villain,\r\nbut on second thought I have decided that it would be rather unfair.\r\nFor at that moment he was at a disadvantage. Nature was punishing him\r\nfor a few shortcomings. The steward that night informed Warburton, in\r\nanswer to his inquiries, that he, the villain, was dreadfully seasick,\r\nand was begging him, the steward, to scuttle the ship and have done\r\nwith it. I have my doubts regarding this. Mr. Robert is inclined to\r\nflippancy at times. It wasn\u0027t seasickness; and after all is said and\r\ndone, it is putting it harshly to call this man a villain. I recant.\r\nTrue villainy is always based upon selfishness. Remember this, my wise\r\nones.\r\n\r\nWarburton was somewhat subdued when he learned that the suffering\r\ngentleman was _her_ father.\r\n\r\n\"What did you say the name was?\" he asked innocently. Until now he\r\nhadn\u0027t had the courage to put the question to any one, or to prowl\r\naround the purser\u0027s books.\r\n\r\n\"Annesley; Colonel Annesley and daughter,\" answered the unsuspecting\r\nsteward.\r\n\r\nWarburton knew nothing then of the mental tragedy going on behind the\r\ncolonel\u0027s state-room door. How should he have known? On the contrary,\r\nhe believed that the father of such a girl must be a most knightly and\r\ncourtly gentleman. He _was_, in all outward appearance. There had been\r\na time, not long since, when he had been knightly and courtly in all\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nSurrounding every upright man there is a mire, and if he step not\r\nwisely, he is lost. There is no coming back; step by step he must go on\r\nand on, till he vanishes and a bubble rises over where he but lately\r\nstood. That he misstepped innocently does not matter; mire and evil\r\nhave neither pity nor reason. To spend what is not ours and then to try\r\nto recover it, to hide the guilty step: this is futility. From the\r\nalpha men have made this step; to the omega they will make it, with the\r\nsame unchanging futility. After all, it _is_ money. Money _is_ the root\r\nof all evil; let him laugh who will, in his heart of hearts he knows it.\r\n\r\nMoney! Have you never heard that siren call to you, call seductively\r\nfrom her ragged isle, where lurk the reefs of greed and selfishness?\r\nMoney! What has this siren not to offer? Power, ease, glory, luxury;\r\naye, I had almost said love! But, no; love is the gift of God, money is\r\nthe invention of man: all the good, all the evil, in the heart of this\r\ngreat humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENTURE BEGINS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was only when the ship was less than a day\u0027s journey off Sandy Hook\r\nthat the colonel came on deck, once more to resume his interest in\r\nhuman affairs. How the girl hovered about him! She tucked the shawl\r\nmore snugly around his feet; she arranged and rearranged the pillows\r\nback of his head; she fed him from a bowl of soup; she read from some\r\nfavorite book; she smoothed the furrowed brow; she stilled the long,\r\nwhite, nervous fingers with her own small, firm, brown ones; she was\r\nmother and daughter in one. Wherever she moved, the parent eye followed\r\nher, and there lay in its deeps a strange mixture of fear, and trouble,\r\nand questioning love. All the while he drummed ceaselessly on the arms\r\nof his chair.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Robert, watching all these things from afar, Mr. Robert sighed\r\ndolorously. The residue air in his lungs was renewed more frequently\r\nthan nature originally intended it should be. Love has its beneficences\r\nas well as its pangs, only they are not wholly appreciable by the\r\nrecipient. For what is better than a good pair of lungs constantly\r\nfilled and refilled with pure air? Mr. Robert even felt a twinge of\r\nremorse besides. He was brother to a girl almost as beautiful as yonder\r\none (to my mind far more beautiful!) and he recalled that in two years\r\nhe had not seen her nor made strenuous efforts to keep up the\r\ncorrespondence. Another good point added to the score of love! And,\r\nalas! he might never see this charming girl again, this daughter so\r\nfull of filial love and care. He had sought the captain, but that hale\r\nand hearty old sea-dog had politely rebuffed him.\r\n\r\n\"My dear young man,\" he said, \"I do all I possibly can for the\r\nentertainment and comfort of my passengers, but in this case I must\r\nrefuse your request.\"\r\n\r\n\"And pray, why, sir?\" demanded Mr. Robert, with dignity.\r\n\r\n\"For the one and simple reason that Colonel Annesley expressed the\r\ndesire to be the recipient of no ship introductions.\"\r\n\r\n\"What the deuce is he, a billionaire?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have me there, sir. I confess that I know nothing whatever about\r\nhim. This is the first time he has ever sailed on my deck.\"\r\n\r\nAll of which perfectly accounts for Mr. Robert\u0027s sighs in what\r\nmusicians call the _doloroso_. If only he knew some one who knew the\r\ncolonel! How simple it would be! Certainly, a West Point graduate would\r\nfind some consideration. But the colonel spoke to no one save his\r\ndaughter, and his daughter to none but her parent, her maid, and the\r\nstewardess. Would they remain in New York, or would they seek their\r\nfar-off southern home? Oh, the thousands of questions which surged\r\nthrough his brain! From time to time he glanced sympathetically at the\r\ncolonel, whose fingers drummed and drummed and drummed.\r\n\r\n\"Poor wretch! his stomach must be in bad shape. Or maybe he has the\r\npalsy.\" Warburton mused upon the curious incertitude of the human\r\nanatomy.\r\n\r\nBut Colonel Annesley did not have the palsy. What he had is at once the\r\ngreatest blessing and the greatest curse of God--remembrance, or\r\nconscience, if you will.\r\n\r\nWhat a beautiful color her hair was, dappled with sunshine and shadow!\r\n... Pshaw! Mr. Robert threw aside his shawl and book (it is of no real\r\nimportance, but I may as well add that he never completed the reading\r\nof that summer\u0027s most popular novel) and sought the smoking-room,\r\nwhere, with the aid of a fat perfecto and a liberal stack of blues, he\r\nproceeded to divert himself till the boat reached quarantine. I shall\r\nnot say that he left any of his patrimony at the mahogany table with\r\nits green-baize covering and its little brass disks for cigar ashes,\r\nbut I am certain that he did not make one of those stupendous winnings\r\nwe often read about and never witness. This much, however: he made the\r\nacquaintance of a very important personage, who was presently to add no\r\ninsignificant weight on the scales of Mr. Robert\u0027s destiny.\r\n\r\nHe was a Russian, young, handsome, suave, of what the newspapers insist\r\non calling distinguished bearing. He spoke English pleasantly but\r\nimperfectly. He possessed a capital fund of anecdote, and Warburton,\r\nbeing an Army man, loved a good droll story. It was a revelation to see\r\nthe way he dipped the end of his cigar into his coffee, a stimulant\r\nwhich he drank with Balzacian frequency and relish. Besides these\r\naccomplishments, he played a very smooth hand at the great American\r\ngame. While Mr. Robert\u0027s admiration was not aroused, it was surely\r\nawakened.\r\n\r\nMy hero had no trouble with the customs officials. A brace of old\r\nFrench dueling pistols and a Turkish simitar were the only articles\r\nwhich might possibly have been dutiable. The inspector looked hard, but\r\nhe was finally convinced that Mr. Robert was _not_ a professional\r\ncurio-collector. Warburton, never having returned from abroad before,\r\nfound a deal of amusement and food for thought in the ensuing scenes.\r\nThere was one man, a prim, irascible old fellow, who was not allowed to\r\npass in two dozen fine German razors. There was a time of it, angry\r\nwords, threats, protestations. The inspector stood firm. The old\r\ngentleman, in a fine burst of passion, tossed the razors into the\r\nwater. Then they were going to arrest him for smuggling. A friend\r\nextricated him. The old gentleman went away, saying something about the\r\ntariff and an unreasonably warm place which has as many synonyms as an\r\noctopus has tentacles.\r\n\r\nAnother man, his mouth covered by an enormous black mustache which must\r\nhave received a bath every morning in coffee or something stronger,\r\ncame forward pompously. I don\u0027t know to this day what magic word he\r\nsaid, but the inspectors took never a peep into his belongings.\r\nDoubtless they knew him, and that his word was as good as his bond.\r\n\r\nHere a woman wept because the necklace she brought trustingly from\r\nRotterdam must be paid for once again; and here another, who clenched\r\nher fists (do women have fists?) and if looks could have killed there\r\nwould have been a vacancy in customs forthwith. All her choicest linen\r\nstrewn about on the dirty boards, all soiled and rumpled and useless!\r\n\r\nWhen the colonel\u0027s turn came, Warburton moved within hearing distance.\r\nHow glorious she looked in that smart gray traveling habit! With what\r\nwell-bred indifference she gazed upon the scene! Calmly her glance\r\npassed among the circles of strange faces, and ever and anon returned\r\nto the great ship which had safely brought her back to her native land.\r\nThere were other women who were just as well-bred and indifferent, only\r\nWarburton had but one pair of eyes. Sighs in the _doloroso_ again. Ha!\r\nif only one of these meddling jackasses would show her some disrespect\r\nand give him the opportunity of avenging the affront!\r\n\r\n(Come, now; let me be your confessor. Have you never thought and acted\r\nlike this hero of mine? Haven\u0027t you been just as melodramatic and\r\nridiculous? It is nothing to be ashamed of. For my part, I should\r\nconfess to it with the same equanimity as I should to the mumps or the\r\nmeasles. It comes with, and is part and parcel of, all that strange\r\nmedley we find in the Pandora box of life. Love has no diagnosis, so\r\nthe doctors say. \u0027Tis all in the angle of vision.)\r\n\r\nBut nothing happened. Colonel Annesley and his daughter were old hands;\r\nthey had gone through all this before. Scarce an article in their\r\ntrunks was disturbed. There was a slight duty of some twelve dollars\r\n(Warburton\u0027s memory is marvelous), and their luggage was free. But\r\nalas, for the perspicacity of the inspectors! I can very well imagine\r\nthe god of irony in no better or more fitting place than in the United\r\nStates Customs House.\r\n\r\nOnce outside, the colonel caught the eye of a cabby, and he and his\r\ndaughter stepped in.\r\n\r\n\"Holland House, sir, did you say?\" asked the cabby.\r\n\r\nThe colonel nodded. The cabby cracked his whip, and away they rolled\r\nover the pavement.\r\n\r\nWarburton\u0027s heart gave a great bound. She had actually leaned out of\r\nthe cab, and for one brief moment their glances had met. Scarce knowing\r\nwhat he did, he jumped into another cab and went pounding after. It was\r\neasily ten blocks from the pier when the cabby raised the lid and\r\npeered down at his fare.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want t\u0027 folly them ahead?\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" Warburton was startled out of his wild dream. \"Drive to the\r\nHolland House--no--to the Waldorf. Yes, the Waldorf; and keep your nag\r\ngoing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Waldorf it is, sir!\" The lid above closed.\r\n\r\nClouds had gathered in the heavens. It was beginning to rain. But\r\nWarburton neither saw the clouds nor felt the first few drops of rain.\r\nAll the way up-town he planned and planned--as many plans as there were\r\ndrops of rain; the rain wet him, but the plans drowned him--he became\r\nsubmerged. If I were an expert at analysis, which I am not, I should\r\nsay that Mr. Robert was not violently in love; rather I should observe\r\nthat he was fascinated with the first really fine face he had seen in\r\nseveral years. Let him never see Miss Annesley again, and in two weeks\r\nhe would entirely forget her. I know enough of the race to be able to\r\nput forward this statement. Of course, it is understood that he would\r\nhave to mingle for the time among other handsome women. Now, strive as\r\nhe would, he could not think out a feasible plan. One plan might have\r\ngiven him light, but the thousand that came to him simply overwhelmed\r\nhim fathoms deep. If he could find some one he knew at the Holland\r\nHouse, some one who would strike up a smoking-room acquaintance with\r\nthe colonel, the rest would be simple enough. Annesley--Annesley; he\r\ncouldn\u0027t place the name. Was he a regular, retired, or a veteran of the\r\nCivil War? And yet, the name was not totally unfamiliar. Certainly, he\r\nwas a fine-looking old fellow, with his white hair and Alexandrian\r\nnose. And here he was, he, Robert Warburton, in New York, simply\r\nbecause he happened to be in the booking office of the _Gare du Nord_\r\none morning and overheard a very beautiful girl say: \"Then we shall\r\nsail from Southampton day after to-morrow.\" Of a truth, it is the\r\ninfinitesimal things that count heaviest.\r\n\r\nSo deep was he in the maze of his tentative romance that when the cab\r\nfinally stopped abruptly, he was totally unaware of the transition from\r\nactivity to passivity.\r\n\r\n\"Hotel, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes!\" Warburton leaped out, fumbled in his pocket, and brought\r\nforth a five-dollar note, which he gave to the cabby. He did not\r\nrealize it, but this was the only piece of American money he had on his\r\nperson. Nor did he wait for the change. Mr. Robert was exceedingly\r\ncareless with his money at this stage of his infatuation; being a\r\nsoldier, he never knew the real value of legal tender. I know that _I_\r\nshould never have been guilty of such liberality, not even if Mister\r\nCabby had bowled me from Harlem to Brooklyn. And you may take my word\r\nfor it, the gentleman in the ancient plug-hat did not wait to see if\r\nhis fare had made a mistake, but trotted away good and hearty. The cab\r\nsystem is one of the most pleasing and amiable phases of metropolitan\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWarburton rushed into the noisy, gorgeous lobby, and wandered about\r\ntill he espied the desk. Here he turned over his luggage checks to the\r\nclerk and said that these accessories of travel must be in his room\r\nbefore eight o\u0027clock that night, or there would be trouble. It was now\r\nhalf after five. The clerk eagerly scanned the register. Warburton,\r\nRobert Warburton; it was not a name with which _he_ was familiar. A\r\nthin film of icy hauteur spread over his face.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, sir. Do you wish a bath with your room?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\" Warburton glanced at his watch again.\r\n\r\n\"The price--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hang the price! A room, a room with a bath--that\u0027s what I want. Have\r\nyou got it?\" This was said with a deal of real impatience and a hauteur\r\nthat overtopped the clerk\u0027s.\r\n\r\nThe film of ice melted into a gracious smile. Some new millionaire from\r\nPittsburg, thought the clerk. He swung the book around.\r\n\r\n\"You have forgotten your place of residence, sir,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Place of residence!\"\r\n\r\nWarburton looked at the clerk in blank astonishment. Place of\r\nresidence? Why, heaven help him, he had none, none! For the first time\r\nsince he left the Army the knowledge came home to him, and it struck\r\nrather deep. He caught up the pen, poised it an indecisive moment, then\r\nhastily scribbled Paris: as well Paris as anywhere. Then he took out\r\nhis wallet, comfortably packed with English and French bank-notes, and\r\na second wave of astonishment rolled over him. Altogether, it was a\r\nrare good chance that he ever came to the surface again. No plan, no\r\nplace of residence, no American money!\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord! I forgot all about exchanging it on shipboard!\" he\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Don\u0027t let that trouble you, sir,\" said the clerk, with real\r\naffability. \"Our own bank will exchange your money in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I haven\u0027t a penny of American money on my person!\"\r\n\r\n\"How much will you need for the evening, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not more than fifty.\"\r\n\r\nThe clerk brought forth a slip of paper, wrote something on it, and\r\nhanded it to Warburton.\r\n\r\n\"Sign here,\" he said, indicating a blank space.\r\n\r\nAnd presently Mr. Robert, having deposited his foreign money in the\r\nsafe, pocketed the receipt for its deposit along with five crisp\r\nAmerican notes. There is nothing lacking in these modern hostelries,\r\nexcepting it be a church.\r\n\r\nOur homeless young gentleman lighted a cigar and went out under the\r\nportico. An early darkness had settled over the city, and a heavy\r\nsteady rain was falling. The asphalt pavements glistened and twinkled\r\nas far as the eye\u0027s range could reach. A thousand lights gleamed down\r\non him, and he seemed to be standing in a canon dappled with fireflies.\r\nPlace of residence! Neither the fig-tree nor the vine! Did he lose his\r\nmoney to-morrow, the source of his small income, he would be without a\r\nroof over his head. True, his brother\u0027s roof would always welcome him:\r\nbut a roof-tree of his own! And he could lay claim to no city, either,\r\nhaving had the good fortune to be born in a healthy country town. Place\r\nof residence! Truly he had none; a melancholy fact which he had not\r\nappreciated till now. And all this had slipped his mind because of a\r\npair of eyes as heavenly blue as a rajah\u0027s sapphire!\r\n\r\nHang it, what should he do, now that he was no longer traveling, now\r\nthat his time was no longer Uncle Sam\u0027s? He had never till now known\r\nidleness, and the thought of it did not run smoothly with the grain. He\r\nwas essentially a man of action. There might be some good sport for a\r\nsoldier in Venezuela, but that was far away and uncertain. It was quite\r\npossible Jack, his brother, might find him a post as military attache,\r\nperhaps in France, perhaps in Belgium, perhaps in Vienna. That was the\r\ngoal of more than one subaltern. The English novelist is to be blamed\r\nfor this ambition. But Warburton could speak French with a certain\r\nfluency, and his German was good enough to swear by; so it will be seen\r\nthat he had some ground upon which to build this ambition.\r\n\r\nHeigho! The old homestead was gone; his sister dwelt under the elder\r\nbrother\u0027s roof; the prodigal was alone.\r\n\r\n\"But there\u0027s always a fatted calf waiting in Washington,\" he laughed\r\naloud. \"Once a soldier, always a soldier. I suppose I\u0027ll be begging the\r\ncolonel to have a chat with the president. There doesn\u0027t seem to be any\r\nway of getting out of it. I\u0027ll have to don the old togs again. I ought\r\nto write a letter to Nancy, but it will be finer to drop in on \u0027em\r\nunexpectedly. Bless her heart! (So say I!) And Jack\u0027s, too, and his\r\nlittle wife\u0027s! And I haven\u0027t written a line in eight weeks. But I\u0027ll\r\nmake it all up in ten minutes. And if I haven\u0027t a roof-tree, at least\r\nI\u0027ve got the ready cash and can buy one any day.\" All of which proves\r\nthat Mr. Robert possessed a buoyant spirit, and refused to be downcast\r\nfor more than one minute at a time.\r\n\r\nHe threw away his cigar and reentered the hotel, and threaded his way\r\nthrough the appalling labyrinths of corridors till he found some one to\r\nguide him to the barber shop, where he could have his hair cut and his\r\nbeard trimmed in the good old American way, money no object. For a plan\r\nhad at last come to him; and it wasn\u0027t at all bad. He determined to\r\ndine at the Holland House at eight-thirty. It was quite possible that\r\nhe would see Her.\r\n\r\nMy only wish is that, when I put on evening clothes (in my humble\r\nopinion, the homeliest and most uncomfortable garb that man ever\r\ninvented!) I might look one-quarter as handsome and elegant as Mr.\r\nRobert looked, as he came down stairs at eight-ten that night. He\r\nwasn\u0027t to be blamed if the women glanced in his direction, and then\r\nwhispered and whispered, and nodded and nodded. Ordinarily he would\r\nhave observed these signs of feminine approval, for there was warm\r\nblood in his veins, and it is proverbial that the Army man is gallant.\r\nBut to-night Diana and her white huntresses might have passed him by\r\nand not aroused even a flicker of interest or surprise on his face.\r\nThere was only one pair of eyes, one face, and to see these he would\r\nhave gladly gone to the ends of the earth, travel-weary though he was.\r\n\r\nHe smoked feverishly, and was somewhat troubled to find that he hadn\u0027t\r\nquite got his land legs, as they say. The floor swayed at intervals,\r\nand the throbbing of the engines came back. He left the hotel, hailed a\r\ncab, and was driven down Fifth Avenue. He stopped before the fortress\r\nof privileges. From the cab it looked very formidable. Worldly as he\r\nwas, he was somewhat innocent. He did not know that New York hotels are\r\nformidable only when your money gives out. To get past all these\r\nbrass-buttoned lackeys and to go on as though he really had business\r\nwithin took no small quantity of nerve. However, he slipped by the\r\noutpost without any challenge and boldly approached the desk. A quick\r\nglance at the register told him that they had indeed put up at this\r\nhotel. He could not explain why he felt so happy over his discovery.\r\nThere are certain exultations which are inexplicable. As he turned away\r\nfrom the desk, he bumped into a gentleman almost as elegantly attired\r\nas himself.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon!\" he cried, stepping aside.\r\n\r\n\"What? Mr. _Warrr_burton?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Robert, greatly surprised and confused, found himself shaking hands\r\nwith his ship acquaintance, the Russian.\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad to see you again, Count,\" said Warburton, recovering.\r\n\r\n\"A great pleasure! It is wonderful how small a city is. I had never\r\nexpect\u0027 to see you again. Are you stopping here?\" I had intended to try\r\nto reproduce the Russian\u0027s dialect, but one dialect in a book is\r\nenough; and we haven\u0027t reached the period of its activity.\r\n\r\n\"No, I am at the Waldorf.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh? I have heard all about you millionaires.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we are not all of us millionaires who stop there,\" laughed\r\nWarburton. \"There are some of us who try to make others believe that we\r\nare.\" Then, dropping into passable French, he added: \"I came here\r\nto-night with the purpose of dining. Will you do me the honor of\r\nsharing my table?\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak French?\"--delighted. \"It is wonderful. This English has so\r\nmany words that mean so many things, that of all languages I speak it\r\nwith the least fluency. But it is my deep regret, Monsieur, to refuse\r\nyour kind invitation. I am dining with friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, breakfast to-morrow at eleven,\" Warburton urged, for he\r\nhad taken a fancy to this affable Russian.\r\n\r\n\"Alas! See how I am placed. I am forced to leave for Washington early\r\nin the morning. We poor diplomats, we earn our honors. But my business\r\nis purely personal in this case, neither political nor diplomatic.\" The\r\ncount drew his gloves thoughtfully through his fingers. \"I shall of\r\ncourse pay my respects to my ambassador. Do I recollect your saying\r\nthat you belonged to the United States Army?\"\r\n\r\n\"I recently resigned. My post was in a wild country, with little or\r\nnothing to do; monotony and routine.\"\r\n\r\n\"You limp slightly?\"\r\n\r\n\"A trifling mishap,\"--modestly.\r\n\r\n\"Eh, you do wrong. You may soon be at war with England, and having\r\nresigned your commission, you would lose all you had waited these years\r\nfor.\"\r\n\r\nWarburton smiled. \"We shall not go to war with England.\"\r\n\r\n\"This Army of yours is small.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes; but made of pretty good material--fighting machines with\r\nbrains.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" The count laughed softly. \"Bah! how I detest all these cars and\r\nships! Will you believe me, I had rather my little chateau, my\r\nvineyard, and my wheat fields, than all the orders.... Eh, well, _my\r\ncountry_: there must be some magic in that phrase. Of all loves, that\r\nof country is the most lasting. Is that Balzac? I do not recall. Only\r\nonce in a century do we find a man who is willing to betray his\r\ncountry, and even then he may have for his purpose neither hate,\r\nrevenge, nor love of power.\" A peculiar gravity sat on his mobile face,\r\ncaused, perhaps, by some disagreeable inward thought.\r\n\r\n\"How long shall you be in Washington?\" asked Warburton.\r\n\r\nThe count shrugged. \"Who can say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I go to Washington myself within a few days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Till we meet again, then, Monsieur.\"\r\n\r\nThe count lifted his hat, a courtesy which was gracefully acknowledged\r\nby the American; while the clerks at the desk eyed with tolerant\r\namusement these polite but rather unfamiliar ceremonies of departure.\r\nThese foreigners were odd duffers.\r\n\r\n\"A very decent chap,\" mused Warburton, \"and a mighty shrewd hand at\r\npoker--for a foreigner. He is going to Washington: we shall meet again.\r\nI wonder if she\u0027s in the restaurant now.\"\r\n\r\nMeet again? Decidedly; and had clairvoyance shown my hero that night\r\nhow he and the count were to meet again, certainly he would have\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\nIf I dared, I should like to say a good deal more about this Russian.\r\nBut I have no desire to lose my head, politically or physically. Even\r\nthe newsboys are familiar with this great young man\u0027s name; and if I\r\nshould disclose it, you would learn a great many things which I have no\r\ndesire that you should. One day he is in Paris, another in Berlin, then\r\noff to Vienna, to Belgrade, or St. Petersburg, or Washington, or\r\nLondon, or Rome. A few months ago, previous to this writing, he was in\r\nManchuria; and to this very day England and Japan are wondering how it\r\nhappened; not his being there, mind you, but the result. Rich, that is\r\nto say independent; unmarried, that is to say unattached; free to come\r\nand go, he stood high up in that great army of the czar\u0027s, which I call\r\nthe uncredited diplomatic corps, because the phrase \"secret service\"\r\nalways puts into my mind a picture of the wild-eyed, bearded anarchist,\r\nwhom I most heartily detest.\r\n\r\nWhat this remarkable diplomatic free-lance did in Washington was\r\nhonestly done in the interests of his country. A Russ understands honor\r\nin the rough, but he lacks all those delicate shadings which make the\r\nword honor the highest of all words in the vocabularies of the Gaul and\r\nthe Saxon. And while I do not uphold him in what he did, I can not\r\nplace much blame at the count\u0027s door. Doubtless, in his place, and\r\ngiven his cast of mind, I might have done exactly as he did. Russia\r\nnever asks how a thing is done, but why it is _not_ done. Ah, these\r\nAspasias, these Circes, these Calypsos, these Cleopatras, with their\r\nblue, their gray, their amber eyes! I have my doubts concerning Jonah,\r\nbut, being a man, I am fully convinced as to the history of Eve. And\r\nyet, the woman in this case was absolutely innocent of any guile,\r\nunless, a pair of eyes as heavenly blue as a rajah\u0027s sapphire may be\r\ncalled guile.\r\n\r\nPardon me this long parenthesis. By this time, no doubt, Mr. Robert has\r\nentered the restaurant We shall follow him rather than this aimless\r\ntrain of thought.\r\n\r\nMr. Robert\u0027s appetite, for a healthy young man, was strangely\r\nincurious. He searched the menu from top to bottom, and then from\r\nbottom to top; nothing excited his palate. Whenever persons entered, he\r\nwould glance up eagerly, only to feel his heart sink lower and lower. I\r\ndon\u0027t know how many times he was disappointed. The waiter ahemmed\r\npolitely. Warburton, in order to have an excuse to remain, at length\r\nhit upon a partridge and a pint of Chablis.\r\n\r\nNine o\u0027clock. Was it possible that the colonel and his daughter were\r\ndining in their rooms? Perish the possibility! And he looked in vain\r\nfor the count. A quarter-past nine. Mr. Robert\u0027s anxiety was becoming\r\nalmost unendurable. Nine-thirty. He was about to surrender in despair.\r\nHis partridge lay smoking on his plate, and he was on the point of\r\ndemolishing it, when, behold! they came. The colonel entered first,\r\nthen his daughter, her hand--on--the--arm--of--the--count! Warburton\r\nnever fully described to me his feelings at that moment; but, knowing\r\nhim as I do, I can put together a very, respectable picture of the\r\nchagrin and consternation that sat on his countenance.\r\n\r\n\"To think of being nearly six days aboard,\" Mr. Robert once bawled at\r\nme, wrathfully, \"and not to know that that Russian chap knew her!\" It\r\n_was_ almost incredible that such a thing should happen.\r\n\r\nThe three sat down at a table seven times removed from Warburton\u0027s. He\r\ncould see only an adorable profile and the colonel\u0027s handsome but\r\ncare-worn face. The count sat with his back turned. In that black\r\nevening gown she was simply beyond the power of adjectives. What\r\nshoulders, what an incomparable throat! Mr. Robert\u0027s bird grew cold;\r\nthe bouquet from his glass fainted and died away. How her face lighted\r\nwhen she laughed, and she laughed frequently! What a delicious curve\r\nran from her lips to her young bosom! But never once did she look in\r\nhis direction. Who invented mirrors, the Egyptians? I can not say.\r\nThere were mirrors in the room, but Mr. Robert did not realize it. He\r\nhas since confessed to me that he hadn\u0027t the slightest idea how much\r\nhis bird and bottle cost. Of such is love\u0027s young dream! (Do I worry\r\nyou with all these repetitious details? I am sorry.)\r\n\r\nAt ten o\u0027clock Miss Annesley rose, and the count escorted her to the\r\nelevator, returning almost immediately. He and the colonel drew their\r\nheads together. From time to time the count shrugged, or the colonel\r\nshook his head. Again and again the Russian dipped the end of his cigar\r\ninto his coffee-cup, which he frequently replenished.\r\n\r\nBut for Mr. Robert the gold had turned to gilt, the gorgeous to the\r\ngaudy. She was gone. The imagination moves as swiftly as light, leaping\r\nfrom one castle in air to another, and still another. Mr. Robert was\r\nthe architect of some fine ones, I may safely assure you. And he didn\u0027t\r\nmind in the least that they tumbled down as rapidly as they builded:\r\nonly, the incentive was gone. What the colonel had to say to the count,\r\nor the count to the colonel, was of no interest to him; so he made an\r\norderly retreat.\r\n\r\nI am not so old as not to appreciate his sleeplessness that night. Some\r\nbeds are hard, even when made of the softest down.\r\n\r\nIn the morning he telephoned to the Holland House. The Annesleys, he\r\nwas informed, had departed for parts unknown. The count had left\r\ndirections to forward any possible mail to the Russian Embassy,\r\nWashington. Sighs in the _doloroso_; the morning papers and numerous\r\ncigars; a whisky and soda; a game of indifferent billiards with an\r\naffable stranger; another whisky and soda; and a gradual reclamation of\r\nMr. Robert\u0027s interest in worldly affairs.\r\n\r\nShe was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nA FAMILY REUNION\r\n\r\n\r\nWarburton had not been in the city of Washington within twelve years.\r\nIn the past his furloughs had been spent at his brother\u0027s country home\r\nin Larchmont, out of New York City. Thus, when he left the train at the\r\nBaltimore and Potomac station, he hadn\u0027t the slightest idea where Scott\r\nCircle was. He looked around in vain for the smart cab of the northern\r\nmetropolis. All he saw was a line of omnibuses and a few ramshackle\r\nvehicles that twenty years back might very well have passed for\r\nvictorias. A grizzled old negro, in command of one of these sea-going\r\nconveyances, caught Warburton\u0027s eye and hailed jovially. Our hero (as\r\nthe good novelists of the past generation would say, taking their\r\nreaders into their innermost confidences) handed him his traveling case\r\nand stepped in.\r\n\r\n\"Whar to, suh?\" asked the commodore.\r\n\r\n\"Scott Circle, and don\u0027t pommel that old nag\u0027s bones in trying to get\r\nthere. I\u0027ve plenty of time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I reckon I won\u0027t pommel him, suh. Skt! skt!\" And the vehicle rattled\r\nout into broad Pennsylvania Avenue, but for the confusion and absurdity\r\nof its architectural structures, the handsomest thoroughfare in\r\nAmerica. (Some day I am going to carry a bill into Congress and read\r\nit, and become famous as having been the means of making Pennsylvania\r\nAvenue the handsomest highway in the world.)\r\n\r\nWarburton leaned back luxuriously against the faded horse-hair cushion\r\nand lighted a cigar, which he smoked with relish, having had a hearty\r\nbreakfast on the train. It was not quite nine o\u0027clock, and a warm\r\nOctober haze lay on the peaceful city. Here were people who did not\r\nrush madly about in the pursuit of riches. Rather they proceeded along\r\nsoberly, even leisurely, as if they knew what the day\u0027s work was and\r\nthe rewards attendant, and were content. Trucks, those formidable\r\nengines of commerce, neither rumbled nor thundered along the pavements,\r\nnor congested the thoroughfares. Nobody hurried into the shops, nobody\r\nhurried out. There were no scampering, yelling newsboys. Instead, along\r\nthe curbs of the market, sat barelegged negro boys, some of them\r\nselling papers to those who wanted them, and some sandwiched in between\r\nbaskets of popcorn and peanuts. There was a marked scarcity of the\r\nprogressive, intrusive white boy. Old negro mammies passed to and fro\r\nwith the day\u0027s provisions.\r\n\r\nGlancing over his shoulder, Warburton saw the Capitol, shining in the\r\nsun like some enchanted palace out of Wonderland. He touched his cap,\r\nconscious of a thrill in his spine. And there, far to his left, loomed\r\nthe Washington monument, glittering like a shaft of opals. Some\r\norderlies dashed by on handsome bays. How splendid they looked, with\r\ntheir blue trousers and broad yellow stripes! This was before the Army\r\nadopted the comfortable but shabby brown duck. How he longed to throw a\r\nleg over the back of a good horse and gallop away into the great green\r\ncountry beyond!\r\n\r\nIn every extraordinary looking gentleman he saw some famed senator or\r\ncongressman or diplomat. He was almost positive that he saw the\r\nsecretary of war drive by in a neat brougham. The only things which\r\nmoved with the hustling spirit of the times were the cables, and\r\ndoubtless these would have gone slower but for the invisible and\r\nimmutable power which propelled them. On arriving in New York, one\u0027s\r\nfirst thought is of riches; in Washington, of glory. What a difference\r\nbetween this capital and those he had seen abroad! There was no\r\nmilitarism here, no conscription, no governmental oppression, no signs\r\nof discontent, no officers treading on the rights and the toes of\r\ncivilians.\r\n\r\nBut now he was passing the huge and dingy magic Treasury Building,\r\nround past the Executive Mansion with its spotless white stone, its\r\nstately portico and its plush lawns.\r\n\r\n\"Go slow, uncle; I haven\u0027t seen this place since I was a boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, suh. How d\u0027 y\u0027 like it? Wouldn\u0027 y\u0027 like t\u0027 live in dat house,\r\nsuh?\"--the commodore grinned.\r\n\r\n\"One can\u0027t stay there long enough to please me, uncle. It takes four\r\nyears to get used to it; and then, when you begin to like it, you have\r\nto pack up and clear out.\"\r\n\r\n\"It\u0027s de way dey goes, suh. We go eroun\u0027 Lafayette, er do yuh want t\u0027\r\nsee de Wa\u0027 Depa\u0027tment, suh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind now, uncle; Scott Circle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Scott Circle she am, suh.\"\r\n\r\nThe old ark wheeled round Lafayette Square and finally rolled into\r\nSixteenth Street. When at length it came to a stand in front of a\r\nbeautiful house, Warburton evinced his surprise openly. He knew that\r\nhis brother\u0027s wife had plenty of money, but not such a plenty as to\r\nafford a house like this.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure, uncle, that this is the place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dere\u0027s de Circle, suh, an\u0027 yuh can see de numbuh fo\u0027 y\u0027se\u0027f, suh.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much do I owe you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I reckon \u0027bout fifty cents \u0027ll make it, suh.\"\r\n\r\nWarburton gave him a dollar, marveling at the difference between the\r\ncab hire here and in New York. He grasped his case and leaped up the\r\nsteps two at a bound, and pressed the bell A prim little maid answered\r\nthe call.\r\n\r\n\"Does Mr. John Warburton live here?\" he asked breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fortunate John!\" he cried, pushing past the maid and standing in the\r\nhall of his brother\u0027s household, unheralded and unannounced. \"Jack!\" he\r\nbawled.\r\n\r\nThe maid eyed the handsome intruder, her face expressing the utmost\r\nastonishment. She touched his arm.\r\n\r\n\"Sir!--\" she began.\r\n\r\n\"It\u0027s all right, my dear,\" he interrupted.\r\n\r\nShe stepped back, wondering whether to scream or run.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Jack! I say, you old henpecked, where are you?\"\r\n\r\nThe dining-room door slid back and a tall, studious-looking gentleman,\r\nrather plain than otherwise, stood on the threshold.\r\n\r\n\"Jane, what is all this--Why, Bob, you scalawag!\"--and in a moment they\r\nwere pumping hands at a great rate. The little maid leaned weakly\r\nagainst the balustrade.\r\n\r\n\"Kit, Kit! I say, Kit, come and see who\u0027s here!\" cried John.\r\n\r\nAn extraordinarily pretty little woman, whose pallor any woman would\r\nhave understood, but no man on earth, and who was dressed in a charming\r\npink negligee morning-gown, hurried into the hall.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it\u0027s Bob!\" She flung her arms around the prodigal and kissed him\r\nheartily, held him away at arm\u0027s length, and hugged and kissed him\r\nagain. I\u0027m not sure that Mr. Robert didn\u0027t like it.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a swish of starched skirts on the stairs, and the\r\nmost beautiful woman in all the world (and I am always ready to back\r\nthis statement with abundant proofs!) rushed down and literally threw\r\nherself into Mr. Robert\u0027s eager, outstretched arms.\r\n\r\n\"Nancy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bob! Bob! you wicked boy! You almost break our hearts. Not a line in\r\ntwo months!--How could you!--You might have been dead and we not know\r\nit!\"--and she cried on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Come now, Nancy; nonsense! You\u0027ll start the color running out of this\r\ntie of mine!\" But for all his jesting tone, Mr. Robert felt an\r\nembarrassing lump wriggle up and down in his throat.\r\n\r\n\"Had your breakfast?\" asked the humane and practical brother.\r\n\r\n\"Yep. But I shouldn\u0027t mind another cup of coffee.\"\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon he was hustled into the dining-room and pushed into the\r\nbest chair. How the clear women fussed over him, pressed this upon him\r\nand that; fondled and caressed him, just as if the beggar was worth all\r\nthis trouble and love and affection!\r\n\r\n\"Hang it, girls, it\u0027s worth being an outlaw to come to this,\" he cried.\r\nHe reached over and patted Nancy on the cheek, and pressed the young\r\nwife\u0027s hand, and smiled pleasantly at his brother. \"Jack, you lucky\r\npup, you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Two years,\" murmured Nancy; \"and we haven\u0027t had a glimpse of you in\r\ntwo long years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only in photograph,\" said the homeless one, putting three lumps of\r\nsugar into his coffee because he was so happy he didn\u0027t know what he\r\nwas about.\r\n\r\n\"And you have turned twenty-eight,\" said Kit, counting on her fingers.\r\n\r\n\"That makes you twenty-four, Nan,\" Jack laughed.\r\n\r\n\"And much I care!\" replied Nancy, shaking her head defiantly. I\u0027ve a\r\nsneaking idea that she was thinking of me when she made this\r\ndeclaration. For if _I_ didn\u0027t care, why should she?\r\n\r\n\"A handsome, stunning girl like you, Nan, ought to be getting married,\"\r\nobserved the prodigal. \"What\u0027s the matter with all these dukes and\r\nlords and princes, anyhow?\"\r\n\r\nAn embarrassed smile ran around the table, but Mr. Robert missed it by\r\nsome several inches.\r\n\r\nJack threw a cigar across the table. \"Now,\" said he, \"where the deuce\r\ndid you come from?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indirectly from Arizona, which is a synonym, once removed, for war.\"\r\n\r\nJack looked at his plate and laughed; but Mrs. Jack wanted to know what\r\nBob meant by that.\r\n\r\n\"It\u0027s a word used instead of war, as applied by the late General\r\nSherman,\" Jack replied. \"And I am surprised that a brother-in-law of\r\nyours should so far forget himself as to hint it, even.\"\r\n\r\nKnowing that she could put him through the inquisition later, she asked\r\nmy hero how his leg was.\r\n\r\n\"It aches a little when it rains; that\u0027s about all.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you never let us know anything about it till the thing was all\r\nover,\" was Nancy\u0027s reproach.\r\n\r\n\"What\u0027s the use of scaring you women?\" Robert demanded. \"You would have\r\nhad hysterics and all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"We heard of it quick enough through the newspapers,\" said Jack. \"Come,\r\ngive us your own version of the rumpus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the truth is,\"--and the prodigal told them his tale.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you are a hero!\" cried Mrs. Jack, clasping her hands.\r\n\r\n\"Hero nothing,\" sniffed the elder brother. \"He was probably star-gazing\r\nor he wouldn\u0027t have poked his nose into an ambush.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right you are, brother John,\" Robert acknowledged, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"And how handsome he has grown, Nancy,\" Mrs. Jack added, with an\r\noblique glance at her husband.\r\n\r\n\"He does look \u0027distangy\u0027,\" that individual admitted. A handsome face\r\nalways went through John\u0027s cuirass. It was all nonsense, for his wife\r\ncould not have adored him more openly had he been the twin to Adonis.\r\nBut, there you are; a man always wants something he can not have. John\r\nwasn\u0027t satisfied to be one of the most brilliant young men in\r\nWashington; he also wanted to be classed among the handsomest.\r\n\r\n\"By the way, Jack,\" said my hero, lighting the cigar and blowing the\r\nfirst puff toward the ceiling, his face admirably set with nonchalance,\r\n\"do you know of a family named Annesley--Colonel Annesley?\" I knew it\r\nwould take only a certain length of time for this question to arrive.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel Annesley? Why, yes. He was in the War Department until a year\r\nor so ago. A fine strategist; knows every in and out of the coast\r\ndefenses, and is something of an inventor; lots of money, too. Tall,\r\nhandsome old fellow?\"\r\n\r\n\"That\u0027s the man. A war volunteer?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, a regular. Crippled his gun-fingers in some petty Indian war, and\r\nwas transferred to the Department. He was a widower, if my recollection\r\nof him is correct; and had a lovely daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" There was great satisfaction evident in this syllable. \"Do you\r\nknow where the colonel is now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the faintest idea. He lived somewhere in Virginia. But he\u0027s been\r\non the travel for several years.\"\r\n\r\nRobert stirred his coffee and took a spoonful--and dropped the spoon.\r\n\"Pah! I must have put in a quart of sugar. Can you spare me another\r\ncup?\"\r\n\r\n\"Annesley?\" Nancy\u0027s face brightened. \"Colonel Annesley? Why, I know\r\nBetty Annesley. She was my room-mate at Smith one year. She was in my\r\ngraduating class. I\u0027ll show you her picture later. She was the dearest\r\ngirl! How she loved horses! But why are you so interested?\"--slyly.\r\n\r\n\"I ran across them coming home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you met Betty! Isn\u0027t she just the loveliest girl you ever saw?\"\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027m for her, one and indivisible. But hang my luck, I never came\r\nwithin a mile of an introduction.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? You, and on shipboard where she couldn\u0027t get away?\" John threw\r\nup his hands as a sign that this information had overcome him.\r\n\r\n\"Even the captain shied when I approached him,\" said Robert, gloomily.\r\n\r\n\"I begin to see,\" said the brother.\r\n\r\n\"See what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have a match; your cigar has gone out.\"\r\n\r\nRobert relighted his cigar and puffed like a threshing-machine engine.\r\n\r\nJohn leaned toward Nancy. \"Shall I tell him, Nan?\"\r\n\r\nNancy blushed. \"I suppose he\u0027ll have to know sooner or later.\"\r\n\r\n\"Know what?\" asked the third person singular\r\n\r\n\"Your charming sister is about to bring you a brother-in-law.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" You could have heard this across the street.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Bobby dear. And don\u0027t look so hurt. You don\u0027t want me to become\r\nan old maid, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"When did it happen?\"--helplessly. How the thought of his sister\u0027s\r\nmarrying horrifies a brother! I believe I can tell you why. Every\r\nbrother knows that no man is good enough for a good woman. \"When did it\r\nhappen?\" Mr. Robert repeated, with a look at his brother, which said\r\nthat _he_ should be held responsible.\r\n\r\n\"Last week.\"\r\n\r\nRobert took in a long breath, as one does who expects to receive a blow\r\nof some sort which can not be warded off, and asked: \"Who is it?\" Nancy\r\nmarried? What was the world coming to, anyhow?\r\n\r\n\"Charlie Henderson,\"--timidly.\r\n\r\nThen Robert, who had been expecting nothing less than an English duke,\r\nlet loose the flaming ions of his righteous wrath.\r\n\r\n\"Chuck Henderson?--that duffer?\" (Oh, Mr. Robert, Mr. Robert; and after\r\nall I\u0027ve done for you!)\r\n\r\n\"He\u0027s not a duffer!\" remonstrated Nancy, with a flare in her mild eyes.\r\n(How I wish I might have seen her as she defended me!) \"He\u0027s the\r\ndearest fellow in the world, and I love him with all my heart!\" (How do\r\nyou like that, Mr. Robert? Bravo, Nancy! I may be a duffer, true\r\nenough, but I rather object to its being called out from the\r\nhousetops.) And Nancy added: \"I want you to understand distinctly,\r\nRobert, that in my selection of a husband you are not to be consulted.\"\r\n\r\nThis was moving him around some.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on, Nan! Drat it, don\u0027t look like that! I meant nothing, dearie;\r\nonly I\u0027m a heap surprised. Chuck _is_ a good fellow, I\u0027ll admit; but\r\nI\u0027ve been dreaming of your marrying a prince or an ambassador, and\r\nHenderson comes like a jolt. Besides, Chuck will never be anything but\r\na first-rate politician. You\u0027ll have to get used to cheap cigars and\r\nfour-ply whisky. When is it going to happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"In June. I have always loved him, Bob. And he wants you to be his best\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\nRobert appeared a bit mollified at this knowledge. \"But what shall I do\r\nafter that?\" he wailed. \"You\u0027re the only person I can order about, and\r\nnow you\u0027re going the other side of the range.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bob, why don\u0027t you get married yourself?\" asked Mrs. Warburton. \"With\r\nyour looks you won\u0027t have to go far nor begging for a wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"There\u0027s the rub, sister mine by law and the admirable foresight of my\r\nonly brother. What am I good for but ordering rookies about? I\u0027ve no\r\nbusiness head. And it\u0027s my belief that an Army man ought never to wed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Marry, my boy, and I\u0027ll see what can be done for you in the diplomatic\r\nway. The new administration will doubtless be Republican, and my\r\ninfluence will have some weight,\"--and John smiled affectionately\r\nacross the table. He loved this gay lad opposite, loved him for his own\r\nself and because he could always see the mother\u0027s eyes and lips. \"You\r\nhave reached the age of discretion. You are now traveled and a fairly\r\ngood linguist. You\u0027ve an income of forty-five hundred, and to this I\r\nmay be able to add a berth worth two or three thousand. Find the girl,\r\nlad; find the girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Honestly, I\u0027ll think it over, Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\"\r\n\r\nThree of the quartet turned wonderingly toward Mrs. Jack.\r\n\r\n\"What\u0027s the matter?\" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\"We have forgotten to show Bob the baby!\"\r\n\r\n\"Merciful heavens!\" bawled Robert. \"A baby? This is the first time I\u0027ve\r\nheard anything about a baby,\"--looking with renewed interest at the\r\nyoung mother.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to tell me, John Warburton, that you failed to mention the\r\nfact in any of your letters?\" indignantly demanded Mrs. John.\r\n\r\n\"Why--er--didn\u0027t I mention it?\" asked the perturbed father.\r\n\r\n\"Nary a word, nary a word!\" Robert got up. \"Now, where is this\r\nwonderful he?--or is it a she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Boy, Bob; greatest kid ever.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they all trooped up the stairs to the nursery, where Mr. Robert was\r\nforced to admit that, as regarded a three-months-old, this was the\r\nhandsomest little colt he had ever laid eyes on! Mr. Robert even\r\nventured to take the boy up in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"How d\u0027ye hold him?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nMrs. John took the smiling cherub, and the manner in which she folded\r\nthat infant across her young breast was a true revelation to the\r\nprodigal, who felt his loneliness more than ever. He was a rank\r\noutsider.\r\n\r\n\"Jack, you get me that diplomatic post, and I\u0027ll see to it that the\r\nonly bachelor in the Warburton family shall sleep in yonder cradle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Done!\"\r\n\r\n\"How long is your furlough?\" asked Nancy.\r\n\r\n\"Whom do you think the baby resembles?\" asked the mother.\r\n\r\n\"One at a time, one at a time! The baby at present doesn\u0027t resemble any\r\none.\"\r\n\r\n\"There\u0027s your diplomat!\" cried John, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"And my furlough is for several years, if not longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" This query was general and simultaneous.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I\u0027ve disbanded. The Army will now go to rack and ruin. I am a\r\nplain citizen of the United States. I expect to spend the winter in\r\nWashington.\"\r\n\r\n\"The winter!\" echoed Jack, mockingly dejected.\r\n\r\n\"John!\" said his wife. John assumed a meek expression; and Mrs. John,\r\nputting the baby in the cradle, turned to her brother-in-law. \"I\r\nthought the Army was a hobby with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was. I\u0027ve saved up quite a sum, and I\u0027m going to see a lot of fine\r\nscenery if my leg doesn\u0027t give out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or your bank account,\" supplemented John.\r\n\r\n\"Well, or my bank account.\"\r\n\r\n\"Draw on me whenever you want passage out West,\" went on the statesman\r\nin chrysalis.\r\n\r\nWhereupon they all laughed; not because John had said anything\r\nparticularly funny, but because there was a good and generous measure\r\nof happiness in each heart.\r\n\r\n\"Bob, there\u0027s a ball at the British embassy tonight. You must go with\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\" said Robert. \"Remember my leg.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will not matter,\" said Mrs. John; \"you need not dance.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, not dance? I should die of intermittent fever. And if I did\r\ndance, my leg might give out.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can ride a horse all right,\" said John, in the way of argument.\r\n\r\n\"I can do that easily with my knees. But I can\u0027t dance with my knees.\r\nNo, I shall stay at home. I couldn\u0027t stand it to see all those famous\r\nbeauties, and with me posing as a wall-flower.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what will you do here all alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Play with the kid, smoke and read; make myself at home. You still\r\nsmoke that Louisiana, Jack?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\"--dubiously.\r\n\r\n\"So. Now, don\u0027t let me interfere with your plans for tonight. I haven\u0027t\r\nbeen in a home in so long that it will take more than one night for the\r\nnovelty to wear off. Besides, that nurse of yours, Kit, is good to look\r\nat,\"--a bit of the rogue in his eye.\r\n\r\n\"Bob!\"--from both women.\r\n\r\n\"I promise not to look at her; I promise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I must be off,\" said John. \"I\u0027m late now. I\u0027ve a dozen plans for\r\ncoast defenses to go over with an inventor of a new carriage-gun. Will\r\nyou go with me, while I put you up at the Metropolitan, or will you\r\ntake a shopping trip with the women?\"\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027ll take the shopping trip. It will be a sensation. Have you any\r\nhorses?\"\r\n\r\n\"Six.\"\r\n\r\n\"Six! You _are_ a lucky pup: a handsome wife, a bouncing boy, and six\r\nhorses! Where\u0027s the stable?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the rear. I keep only two stablemen; one to take care of the horses\r\nand one to act as groom. I\u0027m off. I\u0027ve a cracking good hunter, if you\u0027d\r\nlike a leg up. We\u0027ll all ride out to Chevy Chase Sunday. By-by, till\r\nlunch.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Robert immediately betook himself to the stables, where he soon\r\nbecame intimately acquainted with the English groom. He fussed about\r\nthe harness-room, deplored the lack of a McClelland saddle, admired the\r\nEnglish curbs, and complimented the men on the cleanliness of the\r\nstables. The men exchanged sly smiles at first, but these smiles soon\r\nturned into grins of admiration. Here was a man who knew a horse from\r\nhis oiled hoofs to his curried forelock.\r\n\r\n\"This fellow ought to jump well,\" he said, patting the sleek neck of\r\nthe hunter.\r\n\r\n\"He does that, sir,\" replied the groom. \"He has never taken less than a\r\nred ribbon. Only one horse beat him at the bars last winter in New\r\nYork. It was Mr. Warburton\u0027s fault that he did not take first prize. He\r\nrode him in the park the day before the contest, and the animal caught\r\na bad cold, sir.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then it was that this hero of mine conceived his great (not to say\r\nyoung and salad) idea. It appealed to him as being so rich an idea that\r\nthe stables rang with his laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\" politely inquired the groom.\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027m not laughing at your statement, my good fellow; rather at an idea\r\nwhich just occurred to me. In fact, I believe that I shall need your\r\nassistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what way, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come with me.\"\r\n\r\nThe groom followed Warburton into the yard, A conversation began in low\r\ntones.\r\n\r\n\"It\u0027s as much as my place is worth, sir. I couldn\u0027t do it, sir,\"\r\ndeclared the groom, shaking his head negatively.\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027ll guarantee that you will not suffer in the least. My brother will\r\nnot discharge you. He likes a joke as well as I do. You are not handed\r\ntwenty dollars every day for a simple thing like this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, sir. I dare say that no harm will come of it. But I am an\r\ninch or two shorter than you.\"\r\n\r\n\"We\u0027ll tide that over.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am at your orders, sir.\" But the groom returned to the stables,\r\nshaking his head dubiously. He was not thoroughly convinced.\r\n\r\nDuring the morning ride down-town the two women were vastly puzzled\r\nover their brother\u0027s frequent and inexplicable peals of laughter.\r\n\r\n\"For mercy\u0027s sake, what do you see that is so funny?\" asked Nancy.\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027m thinking, my dears; only thinking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell us, that we may laugh, too. I\u0027ll wager that you are up to some\r\nmischief, Master Robert. Please tell,\" Nancy urged.\r\n\r\n\"Later, later; at present you would fail to appreciate the joke. In\r\nfact, you might make it miscarry; and that wouldn\u0027t do at all. Have a\r\nlittle patience. It\u0027s a good joke, and you\u0027ll be in it when the time\r\ncomes.\"\r\n\r\nAnd nothing more could they worm out of him.\r\n\r\nI shall be pleased to recount to you the quality of this joke, this\r\nmadcap idea. You will find it lacking neither amusement nor denouement.\r\nAlready I have put forth the casual observation that from Paris to the\r\nthird-precinct police-station in Washington is several thousand miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE PLOT THICKENS\r\n\r\n\r\nAt dinner that night I met my hero face to face for the first time in\r\neight years, and for all his calling me a duffer (I learned of this\r\nonly recently), he was mighty glad to see me, slapped me on the back\r\nand threw his arm across my shoulder. And why shouldn\u0027t he have been\r\nglad? We had been boys together, played hooky many a school-time\r\nafternoon, gone over the same fishing grounds, plunged into the same\r\nswimming-holes, and smoked our first cigar in the rear of my father\u0027s\r\nbarn; and it is the recollection of such things that cements all the\r\nmore strongly friendship in man and man. We recalled a thousand\r\nepisodes and escapades, the lickings we got, and the lickings others\r\ngot in our stead, the pretty school-teacher whom we swore to wed when\r\nwe grew up. Nobody else had a chance to get a word in edgewise. But\r\nNancy laughed aloud at times. She had been a witness to many of these\r\nlong-ago pranks.\r\n\r\n\"What! you are not going to the ball?\" I asked, observing that he wore\r\nonly a dinner-coat and a pair of morocco slippers.\r\n\r\n\"No ball for me. Just as soon as you people hie forth, off comes this\r\nb\u0027iled shirt, and I shall probably meander around the house in my new\r\nsilk pajamas. I shall read a little from Homer--Jack, let me have the\r\nkey to that locked case; I\u0027ve an idea that there must be some robust\r\nold, merry old tales hidden there--and smoke a few pipes.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you are not going to leave Mrs. Warburton and your sister to come\r\nhome without escort?\" I expostulated.\r\n\r\n\"Where the deuce are you two men going?\" Robert asked, surprised.\r\nSomehow, I seemed to catch a joyful rather than a sorrowful note in his\r\ntones.\r\n\r\n\"An important conference at midnight, and heaven only knows how long it\r\nmay last,\" said Jack. \"I wish you would go along, Bob.\"\r\n\r\n\"He can\u0027t go now, anyhow,\" said the pretty little wife. \"He has got to\r\nstay now, whether he will or no. William will see to it that we women\r\nget home all right,\"--and she busied herself with the salad dishes.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I caught Robert\u0027s eye, and we stared hard at each other.\r\n\r\n\"Chuck, you old pirate,\" he said presently, \"what do you mean by coming\r\naround and making love to my sister, and getting her to promise to\r\nmarry you? You know you aren\u0027t good enough for her.\"\r\n\r\nI confess to no small embarrassment. \"I--I know it!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by it, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why--er--that is--Confound you, Bob, _I_ couldn\u0027t help it, and\r\nbesides, I didn\u0027t _want_ to help it! And if you want to have it out--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, pshaw! You know just as well as I do that it is against the law to\r\nhit a man that wears glasses. We\u0027ll call it quits if you\u0027ll promise\r\nthat in the days to come you\u0027ll let me hang around your hymeneal shack\r\nonce in a while.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, if you put it that way!\"--and we were laughing and shaking hands\r\nagain across the table, much to the relief of all concerned.\r\n\r\nDear Nan! I\u0027m not afraid to let the whole world see how much I love\r\nyou. For where exists man\u0027s strength if not in the pride of his love?\r\n\r\n\"What time does the kid get to sleep?\" asked Robert.\r\n\r\n\"He ought to be asleep now,\" said Mrs. W. \"We shall not reach the\r\nembassy until after ten. We have a reception first, and we must leave\r\ncards there. Won\u0027t you be lonesome here, Bobby?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the least in the world;\"--and Bobby began to laugh.\r\n\r\n\"What\u0027s the joke?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me sharply, then shook his head. \"I\u0027ll tell you all about\r\nit to-morrow, Chuck. It\u0027s the kind of joke that has to boil a long time\r\nbefore it gets tender enough to serve.\"\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027d give a good deal to know what is going on behind those eyes of\r\nyours, Bob.\" Nancy\u0027s eyes searched him ruthlessly, but she might just\r\nas well have tried to pierce a stone wall. \"You have been laughing all\r\nday about something, and I\u0027d like to know what about. It\u0027s mischief. I\r\nhaven\u0027t known you all these years for nothing. Now, don\u0027t do anything\r\nsilly, Bob.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nancy,\"--reproachfully--\"I am a man almost thirty; I have passed the\r\nRubicon of cutting up tricks. Go to the ball, you beauty, dance and\r\nrevel to your heart\u0027s content; your brother Robert will manage to pass\r\naway the evening. Don\u0027t forget the key to that private case, Jack,\"--as\r\nthe women left the table to put the finishing touches to their toilets.\r\n\r\n\"Here you are,\" said Jack. \"But mind, you must put those books back\r\njust as you found them, and lock the case. They are rare editions.\"\r\n\r\n\"With the accent on the _rare_, no doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a student, pure and simple,\" said Jack, lowering his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn\u0027t swear to those adjectives,\" returned the scalawag. \"If I\r\nremember, you had the reputation of being a high-jinks man in your\r\nclass at Princeton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sh! Don\u0027t you dare to drag forth any of those fool corpses of college,\r\nor out you go, bag and baggage.\" Jack glanced nervously around the room\r\nand toward the hall.\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow, your wife wouldn\u0027t believe me, no matter what I said\r\nagainst your character. Isn\u0027t that right, Chuck? Jack, you are a lucky\r\ndog, if there ever was one. A handsome wife who loves you, a kid, a\r\nfine home, and plenty of horses. I wonder if you married her for her\r\nmoney?\"\r\n\r\nJack\u0027s eyes narrowed. He seemed to muse. \"Yes, I believe I can do it as\r\neasily as I did fifteen years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do what?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Wallop that kid brother of mine. Bob, I hope you\u0027ll fall desperately\r\nin love some day, and that you will have a devil of a time winning the\r\ngirl. You need something to stir up your vitals. By George! and I hope\r\nshe won\u0027t have a cent of money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lovable brother, that!\" Bob knocked the ash from his cigar and essayed\r\nat laughter which wasn\u0027t particularly felicitous. \"Supposing I was in\r\nlove, new, and that the girl had heaps of money, and all that?\"\r\n\r\n\"_And all that_,\" mimicked the elder brother. \"What does \u0027and all that\u0027\r\nmean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, shut up!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I hope you _are_ in love. It serves you right. You\u0027ve made more\r\nthan one girl\u0027s heart ache, you good-looking ruffian!\"\r\n\r\nThen we switched over to politics, and Robert became an interested\r\nlistener. Quarter of an hour later the women returned, and certainly\r\nthey made a picture which was most satisfactory to the masculine eye.\r\nAh, thou eager-fingered Time, that shall, in days to come, wither the\r\nroses in my beauty\u0027s cheeks, dim the fire in my beauty\u0027s eyes, draw my\r\nbeauty\u0027s bow-lips inward, tarnish the golden hair, and gnarl the\r\nslender, shapely fingers, little shall I heed you in your passing if\r\nyou but leave the heart untouched!\r\n\r\nBob jumped to his feet and kissed them both, a thing I lacked the\r\ncourage to do. How pleased they looked! How a woman loves flattery from\r\nthose she loves!\r\n\r\nWell, William is in front with the carriage; the women are putting on\r\ntheir cloaks, and I am admiring the luxurious crimson fur-lined garment\r\nwhich brother Robert had sent to Nancy from Paris. You will see by this\r\nthat he was not altogether a thoughtless lad. Good-by, Mr. Robert; I\r\nleave you and your guiding-star to bolt the established orbit; for\r\nafter this night the world will never be the same careless,\r\nhappy-go-lucky world. The farce has its tragedy, and what tragedy is\r\nfree of the ludificatory? Youth must run its course, even as the gay,\r\nwild brook must riot on its way to join the sober river.\r\n\r\nI dare say that we hadn\u0027t been gone twenty minutes before Robert stole\r\nout to the stables, only to return immediately with a bundle under his\r\narm and a white felt hat perched rakishly on his head. He was chuckling\r\naudibly to himself.\r\n\r\n\"It will frighten the girls half to death. A gray horse and a bay; oh,\r\nI won\u0027t make any mistake. Let me see; I\u0027ll start about twelve o\u0027clock.\r\nThat\u0027ll get me on the spot just as the boys leave. This is the richest\r\nyet. I\u0027ll wager that there will be some tall screaming.\" He continued\r\nchuckling as he helped himself to his brother\u0027s perfectos and fine old\r\nScotch. I don\u0027t know what book he found in the private case; some old\r\nrascal\u0027s merry tales, no doubt; for my hero\u0027s face was never in repose.\r\n\r\nWe had left Mrs. Secretary-of-the-Interior\u0027s and were entering the red\r\nbrick mansion on Connecticut Avenue. Carriages lined both sides of the\r\nstreet, and mounted police patrolled up and down.\r\n\r\n\"I do hope Bob will not wake up the baby,\" said Mrs. W.\r\n\r\n\"Probably he won\u0027t even take the trouble to look at him,\" replied Jack;\r\n\"not if he gets into that private case of mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can\u0027t understand what you men see in those horrid chronicles,\" Nancy\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\n\"My dear girl,\" said Jack, \"in those days there were no historians;\r\nthey were simply story-tellers, and we get our history from these\r\ntales. The tales themselves are not very lofty, I am willing to admit;\r\nbut they give us a general idea of the times in which the characters\r\nlived. This is called literature by the wise critics.\"\r\n\r\n\"Critics!\" said I; \"humph! Criticism is always a lazy man\u0027s job. When\r\nno two critics think alike, of what use is criticism?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes; I forgot. That book of essays you wrote got several sound\r\ndrubbings. Nevertheless,\" continued Jack, \"what you offer is in the\r\nmain true. Time alone is the true critic. Let him put his mark of\r\napproval on your work, and not all the critical words can bury it or\r\nhinder its light. But Time does not pass his opinion till long after\r\none is dead. The first waltz, dearest, if you think you can stand it.\r\nYou mustn\u0027t get tired, little mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am wonderfully strong to-night,\" said the little mother. \"How\r\nbeautifully it is arranged!\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" we men asked, looking over the rooms.\r\n\r\n\"The figures on Mrs. Secretary-of-State\u0027s gown. The lace is beautiful.\r\nYour brother. Nan, has very good taste for a man. That cloak of yours\r\nis by far the handsomest thing I have seen to-night; and that bit of\r\nscarf he sent me isn\u0027t to be matched.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor boy!\" sighed Nancy. \"I wonder if he\u0027ll be lonely. It\u0027s a shame to\r\nleave him home the very first night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn\u0027t he come, then?\" Mrs. W. shrugged her polished shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my cigars and Scotch are fairly comforting,\" put in Jack,\r\ncomplacently. \"Besides, Jane Isn\u0027t at all bad looking,\"--winking at me.\r\n\"What do you say, Charlie?\"\r\n\r\nBut Charlie had no time to answer. The gray-haired, gray-whiskered\r\nambassador was bowing pleasantly to us. A dozen notable military and\r\nnaval attaches nodded; and we passed on to the ball-room, where the\r\norchestra was playing _A Summer Night in Munich_. In a moment Jack and\r\nhis wife were lost in the maze of gleaming shoulders and white linen.\r\nIt was a picture such as few men, once having witnessed it, can forget.\r\nHere were the great men in the great world: this man was an old\r\nrear-admiral, destined to become the nation\u0027s hero soon; there, a\r\nfamous general, of long and splendid service; celebrated statesmen,\r\ndiplomats, financiers; a noted English duke; a scion of the Hapsburg\r\nfamily; an intimate of the German kaiser; a swart Jap; a Chinaman with\r\nhis peacock feather; tens of men whose lightest word was listened to by\r\nthe four ends of the world; representatives of all the great kingdoms\r\nand states. The President and his handsome wife had just left as we\r\ncame, so we missed that formality, which detracts from the pleasures of\r\nthe ball-room.\r\n\r\n\"Who is that handsome young fellow over there, standing at the side of\r\nthe Russian ambassador\u0027s wife?\" asked Nancy, pressing my arm.\r\n\r\n\"Where? Oh, he\u0027s Count Karloff (or something which sounds like it), a\r\nwealthy Russian, in some way connected with the Russian government; a\r\ndiplomat and a capital fellow, they say. I have never met him. ...\r\nHello! there\u0027s a stunning girl right next to him that I haven\u0027t seen\r\nbefore. ... Where are you going?\"\r\n\r\nNancy had dropped my arm and was gliding kitty-corner fashion, across\r\nthe floor. Presently she and the stunning girl had saluted each other\r\nafter the impulsive fashion of American girls, and were playing\r\ncat-in-the-cradle, to the amusement of those foreigners nearest. A nod,\r\nand I was threading my way to Nancy\u0027s side.\r\n\r\n\"Isn\u0027t it glorious?\" she began. \"This is Miss Annesley, Charlie; Betty,\r\nMr. Henderson.\" Miss Annesley looked mildly curious at Nan, who\r\nsuddenly flushed. \"We are to be married in the spring,\" she explained\r\nshyly; and I dare say that there was a diffident expression on my own\r\nface.\r\n\r\nMiss Annesley gave me her hand, smiling. \"You are a very fortunate man,\r\nMr. Henderson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the shadow of a doubt!\" Miss Annesley, I frankly admitted on the\r\nspot, was, next to Nancy, the handsomest girl I ever saw; and as I\r\nthought of Mr. Robert in his den at home, I sincerely pitied him. I was\r\nwilling to advance the statement that had he known, a pair of crutches\r\nwould not have kept him away from No. 1300 Connecticut Avenue.\r\n\r\nI found three chairs, and we sat down. There was, for me, very little\r\nopportunity to talk. Women always have so much to say to each other,\r\neven when they haven\u0027t seen each other within twenty-four hours. From\r\ntime to time Miss Annesley glanced at me, and I am positive that Nancy\r\nwas extolling my charms. It was rather embarrassing, and I was balling\r\nmy gloves up in a most dreadful fashion. As they seldom addressed a\r\nword to me, I soon became absorbed in the passing scene. I was\r\npresently aroused, however.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Henderson, Count Karloff,\" Miss Annesley was saying. (Karloff is a\r\nname of my own choosing. I haven\u0027t the remotest idea if it means\r\nanything in the Russian language. I hope not.)\r\n\r\n\"Charmed!\" The count\u0027s r\u0027s were very pleasantly rolled. I could see by\r\nthe way his gaze roved from Miss Annesley to Nancy that he was puzzled\r\nto decide which came the nearer to his ideal of womanhood.\r\n\r\nI found him a most engaging fellow, surprisingly well-informed on\r\nAmerican topics. I credit myself with being a fairly good reader of\r\nfaces, and, reading his as he bent it in Miss Annesley\u0027s direction, I\r\nbegan to worry about Mr. Robert\u0027s course of true love. Here was a man\r\nwho possessed a title, was handsome, rich, and of assured social\r\nposition: it would take an extraordinary American girl to look coldly\r\nupon his attentions. By and by the two left us, Miss Annesley promising\r\nto call on Nancy.\r\n\r\n\"And where are you staying, Betty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Father and I have taken Senator Blank\u0027s house in Chevy Chase for the\r\nwinter. My horses are already in the stables. Do you ride?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we shall have some great times together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be sure to call. I want you to meet my brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe I have,\" replied Miss Annesley.\r\n\r\n\"I mean my younger brother, a lieutenant in the Army.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then you have two brothers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Nancy.\r\n\r\n\"The dance is dying, Mademoiselle,\" said the count in French.\r\n\r\n\"Your arm, Monsieur. _Au revoir,_ Nancy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor Bobby!\" Nancy folded her hands and sighed mournfully. \"It appears\r\nto me that his love affair is not going to run very smooth. But isn\u0027t\r\nshe just beautiful, Charlie? What color, what style!\"\r\n\r\n\"She\u0027s a stunner, I\u0027m forced to admit. Bob\u0027ll never stand a ghost of a\r\nshow against that Russian. He\u0027s a great social catch, and is backed by\r\nmany kopecks.\"\r\n\r\n\"How unfortunate we did not know that she would be here! Bobby would\r\nhave met her at his best, and his best is more to my liking than the\r\ncount\u0027s. He has a way about him that the women like. He\u0027s no laggard.\r\nBut money ought not to count with Betty. She is worth at least a\r\nquarter of a million. Her mother left all her property to her, and her\r\nfather acts only as trustee. Senator Blank\u0027s house rents for eight\r\nthousand the season. It\u0027s ready furnished, you know, and one of the\r\nhandsomest homes in Washington. Besides, I do not trust those\r\nforeigners,\"--taking a remarkably abrupt curve, as it were.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"What were you doing off your own box?\" \"Getting on the\r\nwrong box\"--Act I.]\r\n\r\n\"There\u0027s two Bs in your bonnet, Nancy,\" I laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind the Bs; let us have the last of this waltz.\"\r\n\r\nThis is not my own true story; so I shall bow off and permit my hero to\r\nfollow the course of true love, which is about as rough-going a\r\nthoroughfare as the many roads of life have to offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHE MAN ON THE BOX\r\n\r\n\r\nAt eleven-thirty he locked up his book and took to his room the\r\nmysterious bundle which he had purloined from the stables. It contained\r\nthe complete livery of a groom. The clothes fitted rather snugly,\r\nespecially across the shoulders. He stood before the pier-glass, and a\r\ncomplacent (not to say roguish) smile flitted across his face. The\r\nblack half-boots, the white doeskin breeches, the brown brass-buttoned\r\nfrock, and the white hat with the brown cockade. ... Well, my word for\r\nit, he was the handsomest jehu Washington ever turned out. With a grin\r\nhe touched his hat to the reflection in the glass, and burst out\r\nlaughing. His face was as smooth as a baby\u0027s, for he had generously\r\nsacrificed his beard.\r\n\r\nI can hear him saying to himself: \"Lord, but this is a lark! I\u0027ll have\r\nto take another Scotch to screw up the edge of my nerve. Won\u0027t the boys\r\nlaugh when they hear how I stirred the girls\u0027 frizzes! We\u0027ll have a\r\nlittle party here when they all get home. It\u0027s a good joke.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Robert did not prove much of a prophet. Many days were to pass ere\r\nhe reentered his brother\u0027s house.\r\n\r\nHe stole quietly from the place. He hadn\u0027t proceeded more than a block\r\nwhen he became aware of the fact that he hadn\u0027t a penny in his clothes.\r\nThis discovery disquieted him, and he half turned about to go back. He\r\ncouldn\u0027t go back. He had no key.\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw! I won\u0027t need any money;\"--and he started off again toward\r\nConnecticut Avenue. He dared not hail a car, and he would not have\r\ndared had he possessed the fare. Some one might recognize him. He\r\nwalked briskly for ten minutes. The humor of the escapade appealed to\r\nhim greatly, and he had all he could do to smother the frequent bursts\r\nof laughter which surged to his lips. He reached absently for his\r\ncigar-case. No money, no cigars.\r\n\r\n\"That\u0027s bad. Without a cigar I\u0027m likely to get nervous. Scraping off\r\nthat beard made me forgetful. Jove! with these fleshings I feel as\r\nself-conscious as an untried chorus girl. These togs can\u0027t be very warm\r\nin winter. Ha! that must be the embassy where all those lights are;\r\ncarriages. _Allons!_\"\r\n\r\nTo make positive, he stopped a pedestrian.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, sir,\" he said, touching his hat, \"but will you be so kind\r\nas to inform me if yonder is the British embassy?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, my man,\" replied the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\r\n\r\nAnd each passed on to his affairs.\r\n\r\n\"Now for William; we must find William, or the joke will be on Robert.\"\r\n\r\nHe manoeuvered his way through the congested thoroughfare, searching\r\nthe faces of the grooms and footmen. He dodged hither and thither, and\r\nwas once brought to a halt by the mounted police.\r\n\r\n\"Here, you! What d\u0027ye mean by runnin\u0027 around like this? Lost yer\r\ncarriage, hey? I\u0027ve a mind to run ye in. Y\u0027 know th\u0027 rules relatin\u0027 th\u0027\r\nleavin\u0027 of yer box in times like these. Been takin\u0027 a sly nip,\r\nprobably, an\u0027 they\u0027ve sent yer hack down a peg. Get a gait on y\u0027, now.\"\r\n\r\nWarburton laughed silently as he made for the sidewalk. The first man\r\nhe plumped into was William--a very much worried William, too. Robert\r\ncould have fallen on his neck for joy. All was plain sailing now.\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027m very glad to see you, sir,\" said William. \"I was afraid you could\r\nnot get them clothes on, sir. I was getting a trifle worried, too.\r\nHere\u0027s the carriage number.\"\r\n\r\nWarburton glanced hastily at it and stuffed it into a convenient pocket.\r\n\r\n\"It\u0027s sixteen carriages up, sir; a bay and a gray. You can\u0027t miss them.\r\nThe bay, being a saddle-horse, is a bit restive in the harness; but all\r\nyou have to do is to touch him with the whip. And don\u0027t try to push\r\nahead of your turn, or you will get into trouble with the police. They\r\nare very strict. And don\u0027t let them confuse you, sir. The numbers won\u0027t\r\nbe in rotation. You\u0027ll hear one hundred and fifteen, and the next\r\nmoment thirty-five, like as not. It\u0027s all according as to how the\r\nguests are leaving. Good luck to you, sir, and don\u0027t forget to explain\r\nit all thoroughly to Mr. Warburton, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don\u0027t you worry, William; we\u0027ll come out of this with colors flying.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, sir. I shall hang around till you are safely off,\"--and\r\nWilliam disappeared.\r\n\r\nWarburton could occasionally hear the faint strains of music. From time\r\nto time the carriage-caller bawled out a number, and the carriage would\r\nroll up under the porte-cochere. Warburton concluded that it would be a\r\ngood plan to hunt up his rig. His search did not last long. The bay and\r\nthe gray stood only a little way from the gate. The box was vacant, and\r\nhe climbed up and gathered the reins. He sat there for some time,\r\nlonging intensely for a cigar, a good cigar, such as gentlemen smoked.\r\n\r\n\"Seventeen!\" came hoarsely along on the wings of the night. \"Number\r\nseventeen, and lively there!\"\r\n\r\nWarburton\u0027s pulse doubled its beat. His number!\r\n\r\n\"Skt!\" The gray and the bay started forward, took the half-circle and\r\nstopped under the porte-cochere. Warburton recollected that a\r\nfashionable groom never turned his head unless spoken to; so he leveled\r\nhis gaze at his horses\u0027 ears and waited. But from the very corner of\r\nhis eye he caught the glimpse of two women, one of whom was enveloped\r\nin a crimson cloak. He thrilled with exultation. What a joke it was! He\r\nfelt the carriage list as the women stepped in. The door slammed to,\r\nand the rare good joke was on the way.\r\n\r\n\"Off with you!\" cried the pompous footman, with an imperious wave of\r\nthe hand. \"Number ninety-nine!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ninety-nine! Ninety-nine!\" bawled the carriage man.\r\n\r\nOur jehu turned into the avenue, holding a tolerable rein. He clucked\r\nand lightly touched the horses with the lash. _This_ was true sport;\r\n_this_ was humor, genuine, initiative, unforced. He could imagine the\r\ngirls and their fright when he finally slowed down, opened the door,\r\nand kissed them both. Wouldn\u0027t they let out a yell, though? His plan\r\nwas to drive furiously for half a dozen blocks, zigzag from one side of\r\nthe street to the other, taking the corners sharply, and then make for\r\nScott Circle.\r\n\r\nNow, a lad of six can tell the difference between seventeen and\r\nseventy-one. But this astonishing jehu of mine had been conspicuous as\r\nthe worst mathematician and the best soldier in his class at West\r\nPoint. No more did he remember that he was not in the wild West, and\r\nthat here in the East there were laws prohibiting reckless driving.\r\n\r\nHe drove decently enough till he struck Dupont Circle. From here he\r\nturned into New Hampshire, thinking it to be Rhode Island. Mistake\r\nnumber two. He had studied the city map, but he was conscious of not\r\nknowing it as well as he should have known it; but, true to his nature,\r\nhe trusted to luck.\r\n\r\nAside from all this, he forgot that a woman might appreciate this joke\r\nonly when she heard it recounted. To live through it was altogether a\r\ndifferent matter. In an episode like this, a woman\u0027s imagination, given\r\nthe darkness such as usually fills a carriage at night, becomes a round\r\nof terrors. Every moment is freighted with death or disfigurement. Her\r\nnerves are like the taut strings of a harp in a wintry wind, ready to\r\nsnap at any moment; and then, hysteria. With man the play, and only the\r\nplay, is the thing.\r\n\r\nSnap-crack! The surprised horses, sensitive and quick-tempered as all\r\nhighly organized beings are, nearly leaped out of the harness. Never\r\nbefore had their flanks received a more unwarranted stroke of the lash.\r\nThey reared and plunged, and broke into a mad gallop, which was exactly\r\nwhat the rascal on the box desired. An expert horseman, he gauged the\r\nstrength of the animals the moment they bolted, and he knew that they\r\nwere his. Once the rubber-tired vehicle slid sidewise on the wet\r\nasphalt, and he heard a stifled scream.\r\n\r\nHe laughed, and let forth a sounding \"whoop,\" which nowise allayed the\r\nfright of the women inside the carriage. He wheeled into S Street,\r\nscraping the curb as he did so. Pedestrians stopped and stared after\r\nhim. A policeman waved his club helplessly, even hopelessly. On, on: to\r\nWarburton\u0027s mind this ride was as wild as that which the Bishop of\r\nVannes took from Belle-Isle to Paris in the useless effort to save\r\nFouquet from the wrath of Louis XIV, and to anticipate the pregnant\r\ndiscoveries of one D\u0027Artagnan. The screams were renewed. A hand beat\r\nagainst the forward window and a muffled but wrathful voice called\r\nforth a command to stop. This voice was immediately drowned by\r\nanother\u0027s prolonged scream. Our jehu began to find all this very\r\ninteresting, very exciting.\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027ll wager a dollar that Nan isn\u0027t doing that screaming. The\r\nWarburtons never cry out when they are frightened. Hang it!\"--suddenly;\r\n\"this street doesn\u0027t look familiar. I ought to have reached Scott\r\nCircle by this time. Ah! here\u0027s a broader street,\"--going lickety-clip\r\ninto Vermont.\r\n\r\nA glass went jingling to the pavement.\r\n\r\n\"Oho! Nancy will be jumping out the next thing. This will never do.\" He\r\nbegan to draw in.\r\n\r\nHark! His trained trooper\u0027s ear heard other hoofs beating on the\r\niron-like surface of the pavement. Worriedly he turned his head. Five\r\nblocks away there flashed under one of the arc-lights, only to\r\ndisappear in the shadow again, two mounted policemen.\r\n\r\n\"By George! it looks as if the girls were going to have their fun,\r\ntoo!\" He laughed, but there was a nervous catch in his voice. He hadn\u0027t\r\ncounted on any policeman taking part in the comedy. \"Where the devil\r\n_is_ Scott Circle, anyhow?\"--fretfully. He tugged at the reins. \"Best\r\ndraw up at the next corner. I\u0027ll be hanged if _I_ know where I am.\"\r\n\r\nHe braced himself, sawed with the reins, and presently the frightened\r\nand somewhat wearied horses slowed down into a trot. This he finally\r\nbrought to a walk. One more pull, and they came to a stand. It would be\r\nhard to say which breathed the heaviest, the man or the horses.\r\nWarburton leaped from the box, opened the door and waited. He\r\nrecognized the necessity of finishing the play before the mounted\r\npolice arrived on the scene.\r\n\r\nThere was a commotion inside the carriage, then a woman in a crimson\r\ncloak stepped (no, jumped!) out. Mr. Robert threw his arms around her\r\nand kissed her cheek.\r\n\r\n\"You ... vile ... wretch!\"\r\n\r\nWarburton sprang back, his hands applied to his stinging face.\r\n\r\n\"You drunken wretch, how dare you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nan, it\u0027s only I--\" he stammered.\r\n\r\n\"Nan!\" exclaimed the young woman, as her companion joined her. The\r\nlight from the corner disclosed the speaker\u0027s wrathful features,\r\ndisdainful lips, palpitating nostrils, eyes darting terrible glances.\r\n\"Nan! Do you think, ruffian, that you are driving serving-maids?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord!\" Warburton stepped back still farther; stepped back\r\nspeechless, benumbed, terror-struck. The woman he was gazing at was\r\nanybody in the world but his sister Nancy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nA POLICE AFFAIR\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Officers, arrest this fellow!\" commanded the young woman. Her gesture\r\nwas Didoesque in its wrath.\r\n\r\n\"That we will, ma\u0027am!\" cried one of the policemen, flinging himself\r\nfrom his horse. \"So it\u0027s you, me gay buck? Thirty days fer you, an\u0027\r\nmebbe more. I didn\u0027t like yer looks from th\u0027 start. You\u0027re working some\r\nkind of a trick. What complaint, ma\u0027am?\"\r\n\r\n\"Drunkenness and abduction,\"--rubbing the burning spot on her cheek.\r\n\r\n\"That\u0027ll be rather serious. Ye\u0027ll have to appear against him in th\u0027\r\nmornin\u0027, ma\u0027am.\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly shall do so.\" She promptly gave her name, address and\r\ntelephone number.\r\n\r\n\"Bill, you drive th\u0027 ladies home an\u0027 I\u0027ll see this bucko to th\u0027\r\nstation. Here, you!\"--to Warburton, who was still dumb with\r\nastonishment at the extraordinary denouement to his innocent joke. \"Git\r\non that horse, an\u0027 lively, too, or I\u0027ll rap ye with th\u0027 club.\"\r\n\r\n\"It\u0027s all a mistake, officer--\"\r\n\r\n\"Close yer face an\u0027 git on that horse. Y\u0027 can tell th\u0027 judge all that\r\nin th\u0027 mornin\u0027. _I_ ain\u0027t got no time t\u0027 listen. Bill, report just as\r\nsoon as ye see th\u0027 ladies home. Now, off with ye. Th\u0027 ladies\u0027ll be\r\nwantin\u0027 somethin\u0027 t\u0027 quiet their nerves. Git on that horse, me frisky\r\ngroom; hustle!\" Warburton mechanically climbed into the saddle. It\r\nnever occurred to him to parley, to say that he couldn\u0027t ride a horse.\r\nThe inventive cells of his usually fertile brain lay passive. \"Now,\"\r\nwent on the officer, mounting his own nag, \"will ye go quietly? If ye\r\ndon\u0027t I\u0027ll plug ye in th\u0027 leg with a chunk o\u0027 lead. I won\u0027t stan\u0027 no\r\nnonsense.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do with me?\" asked Warburton, with a desperate\r\neffort to collect his energies.\r\n\r\n\"Lock ye up; mebbe throw a pail of water on that overheated cocoanut of\r\nyours.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if you\u0027ll only let me explain to you! It\u0027s all a joke; I got the\r\nwrong carriage--\"\r\n\r\n\"Marines, marines! D\u0027 ye think I was born yestiddy? Ye wanted th\u0027\r\nladies\u0027 sparklers, or I\u0027m a doughhead.\" The police are the same all\r\nover the world; the original idea sticks to them, and truth in voice or\r\npresence is but sign of deeper cunning and villainy. \"Anyhow, ye can\u0027t\r\nrun around Washington like ye do in England, me cockney. Ye can\u0027t drive\r\nmore\u0027n a hundred miles an hour on these pavements.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, I tell you--\" Warburton, realizing where his escapade was about\r\nto lead him, grew desperate. The ignominy of it! He would be the\r\nlaughing-stock of all the town on the morrow. The papers would teem\r\nwith it. \"You\u0027ll find that you are making a great mistake. If you will\r\nonly take me to--Scott Circle--\"\r\n\r\n\"Where ye have a pal with a gun, eh? Git ahead!\" And the two made off\r\ntoward the west.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice the officer found himself admiring the easy seat of his\r\nprisoner; and if the horse had been anything but a trained animal, he\r\nwould have worried some regarding the ultimate arrival at the\r\nthird-precinct.\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen times Warburton was of a mind to make a bolt for it, but\r\nhe did not dare trust the horse or his knowledge of the streets. He had\r\nalready two counts against him, disorderly conduct and abduction, and\r\nhe had no desire to add uselessly a third, that of resisting an\r\nofficer, which seems the greatest possible crime a man can commit and\r\nescape hanging. Oh, for a mettlesome nag! There would be no\r\npolice-station for him, then. Police-station! Heavens, what should he\r\ndo? His brother, his sister; their dismay, their shame; not counting\r\nthat he himself would be laughed at from one end of the continent to\r\nthe other. What an ass he had made of himself! He wondered how much\r\nmoney it would take to clear himself, and at the same moment\r\nrecollected that he hadn\u0027t a cent in his clothes. A sweat of terror\r\nmoistened his brow.\r\n\r\n\"What were ye up to, anyway?\" asked the policeman. \"What kind of booze\r\nhave ye been samplin\u0027?\"\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027ve nothing to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye speak clear enough. So much th\u0027 worse, if ye ain\u0027t drunk. Was ye\r\ncrazy t\u0027 ride like that? Ye might have killed th\u0027 women an\u0027 had a bill\r\nof manslaughter brought against ye.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing to say; it is all a mistake. I got the wrong number and\r\nthe wrong carriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Th\u0027 devil ye did! An\u0027 where was ye goin\u0027 t\u0027 drive th\u0027 other carriage\r\nat that thunderin\u0027 rate? It won\u0027t wash. His honor\u0027ll be stone-deaf when\r\nye tell him that. You\u0027re drunk, or have been.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I\u0027d give me night off t\u0027 know what ye were up to. Don\u0027t ye know\r\nnothin\u0027 about ordinances an\u0027 laws? An\u0027 I wouldn\u0027t mind havin\u0027 ye tell\r\nme why ye threw yer arms around th\u0027 lady an\u0027 kissed her,\"--shrewdly.\r\n\r\nWarburton started in his saddle. He had forgotten all about that part\r\nof the episode. His blood warmed suddenly and his cheeks burned. He had\r\nkissed her, kissed her soundly, too, the most radiantly beautiful woman\r\nin all the world. Why, come to think of it, it was easily worth a night\r\nin jail. Yes, by George, he _had_ kissed her, kissed that blooming\r\ncheek, and but for this policeman, would have forgotten! Whatever\r\nhappened to him, she wouldn\u0027t forget in a hurry. He laughed. The\r\npoliceman gazed at him in pained surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Well, ye seem t\u0027 take it good an\u0027 hearty.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you could only see the humor in it, my friend, you\u0027d laugh, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I would, hey? All I got t\u0027 say is that yer nerve gits me. An\u0027 ye\r\nstand a pretty good show of bein\u0027 rounded up for more\u0027n thirty days,\r\ntoo. Well, ye\u0027ve had yer joke; mebbe ye have th\u0027 price t\u0027 pay th\u0027\r\nfiddler. Turn here.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of the ride was in silence, Warburton gazing callously ahead\r\nand the officer watching him with a wary eye to observe any suggestive\r\nmovement. He couldn\u0027t make out this chap. There was something wrong,\r\nsome deep-dyed villainy--of this he hadn\u0027t the slightest doubt. It was\r\nthem high-toned swells that was the craftiest an\u0027 most daring. Handsome\r\nis that handsome does. A quarter of an hour later they arrived at the\r\nthird precinct, where our jehu was registered for the night under the\r\nname of James Osborne. He was hustled into a small cell and left to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHe had kissed her! Glory of glories! He had pressed her to his very\r\nheart, besides. After all, they couldn\u0027t do anything very serious to\r\nhim. They could not prove the charge of abduction. He stretched himself\r\non the cot, smiled, arranged his legs comfortably, wondered what she\r\nwas thinking of at this moment, and fell asleep. It was a sign of a\r\ngood constitution and a decently white conscience. And thus they found\r\nhim in the morning. They touched his arm, and he awoke with a smile,\r\nthe truest indication of a man\u0027s amiability. At first he was puzzled as\r\nhe looked blinkingly from his jailers to his surroundings and then back\r\nat his jailers. Then it all returned to him, and he laughed. Now the\r\nlaw, as represented and upheld by its petty officers, possesses a\r\ndignity that is instantly ruffled by the sound of laughter from a\r\nprisoner; and Mr. Robert was roughly told to shut up, and that he\u0027d\r\nsoon laugh on the other side of his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"All right, officers, all right; only make allowances for a man who\r\nsees the funny side of things.\" Warburton stood up and shook himself,\r\nand picked up his white hat. They eyed him intelligently. In the\r\nmorning light the young fellow didn\u0027t appear to be such a rascal. It\r\nwas plainly evident that he had _not_ been drunk the preceding night;\r\nfor his eyes were not shot with red veins nor did his lips lack their\r\nusual healthy moisture. The officer who had taken him in charge, being\r\na shrewd and trained observer, noted the white hands, soft and\r\nwell-kept. He shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, me lad, you\u0027re no groom, not by several years. Now, what\r\nth\u0027 devil was ye up to, anyway?\"\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027m not saying a word, sir,\" smiled Warburton. \"All I want to know is,\r\nam I to have any breakfast? I shouldn\u0027t mind some peaches and cream or\r\ngrapes to start with, and a small steak and coffee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye wouldn\u0027t mind, hey?\" mimicked the officer. \"What d\u0027ye think this\r\nplace is, th\u0027 Metropolitan Club? Ye\u0027ll have yer bacon an\u0027 coffee, an\u0027\r\nbe glad t\u0027 git it. They\u0027ll feed ye in th\u0027 mess-room. Come along.\"\r\n\r\nWarburton took his time over the coffee and bacon. He wanted to think\r\nout a reasonable defense without unmasking himself. He was thinking how\r\nhe could get word to me, too. The \"duffer\" might prove a friend in need.\r\n\r\n\"Now where?\" asked Warburton, wiping his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"T\u0027 th\u0027 court. It\u0027ll go hard with ye if ye\u0027re handed over t\u0027 th\u0027 grand\r\njury on th\u0027 charge of abduction. Ye\u0027d better make a clean breast of it.\r\nI\u0027ll speak a word for yer behavior.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren\u0027t you a little curious?\"\r\n\r\n\"It\u0027s a part of me business,\"--gruffly.\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027ll have my say to the judge,\" said Warburton.\r\n\r\n\"That\u0027s yer own affair. Come.\"\r\n\r\nOnce outside, Warburton lost color and a large part of his nonchalance;\r\nfor an open patrol stood at the curb.\r\n\r\n\"Have I got to ride in that?\"--disgustedly.\r\n\r\n\"As true as life; an\u0027 if ye make any disturbance, so much th\u0027 worse.\"\r\n\r\nWarburton climbed in, his face red with shame and anger. He tied his\r\nhandkerchief around his chin and tilted his hat far down over his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"\u0027Fraid of meetin\u0027 some of yer swell friends, hey? Ten t\u0027 one, yer a\r\nswell an\u0027 was runnin\u0027 away with th\u0027 wrong woman. Mind, I have an eye on\r\nye.\"\r\n\r\nThe patrol rumbled over the asphalt on the way down-town. Warburton\r\nburied his face in his hands. Several times they passed a cigar-store,\r\nand his mouth watered for a good cigar, the taste of a clear Havana.\r\n\r\nHe entered the police-court, not lacking in curiosity. It was his first\r\nexperience with this arm of the civil law. He wasn\u0027t sure that he liked\r\nit. It wasn\u0027t an inviting place with its bare benches and its motley,\r\ntawdry throng. He was plumped into a seat between some ladies of\r\nirregular habits, and the stale odor of intoxicants, mingling with\r\ncheap perfumery, took away the edge of his curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, pretty boy; jag?\" asked one of these faded beauties, in an\r\nundertone. She nudged him with her elbow.\r\n\r\n\"No, sweetheart,\" he replied, smiling in spite of himself.\r\n\r\n\"Ah gowan! Been pinching some one\u0027s wad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nope!\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you here for, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Having a good time without anybody\u0027s consent. If you will listen, you\r\nwill soon hear all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Silence there, on the bench!\" bawled the clerk, whacking the desk.\r\n\r\n\"Say, Marie,\" whispered the woman to her nearest neighbor, \"here\u0027s a\r\nboy been selling his master\u0027s harness and got pinched.\"\r\n\r\n\"But look at the sweet things coming in, will you! Ain\u0027t they swell,\r\nthough?\" whispered Marie, nodding a skinny feather toward the door.\r\n\r\nWarburton glanced indifferently in the direction indicated, and\r\nreceived a shock. Two women--and both wore very heavy black veils. The\r\nsmaller of the two inclined her body, and he was sure that her scrutiny\r\nwas for him. He saw her say something into the ear of the companion,\r\nand repeat it to one of the court lawyers. The lawyer approached the\r\ndesk, and in his turn whispered a few words into the judge\u0027s ear. The\r\nmagistrate nodded. Warburton was conscious of a blush of shame. This\r\nwas a nice position for any respectable woman to see him in!\r\n\r\n\"James Osborne!\" called the clerk.\r\n\r\nAn officer beckoned to James, and he made his way to the prisoner\u0027s\r\nbox. His honor looked him over coldly.\r\n\r\n\"Name?\"\r\n\r\n\"James Osborne.\"\r\n\r\n\"Born here?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say \u0027sir\u0027.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where were you born?\"\r\n\r\n\"In New York State.\"\r\n\r\n\"How old are you? And don\u0027t forget to say \u0027sir\u0027 when you reply to my\r\nquestions.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am twenty-eight, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Married?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long have you been engaged as a groom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not very long, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long?\"\r\n\r\n\"Less than twenty-four hours, sir.\"\r\n\r\nSurprise rippled over the faces of the audience on the benches.\r\n\r\n\"Humph! You are charged with disorderly conduct, reckless driving, and\r\nattempted abduction. The last charge has been withdrawn, fortunately\r\nfor you, sir. Have you ever been up before?\"\r\n\r\n\"Up, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"A prisoner in a police-court.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-five for reckless driving and ten for disorderly conduct; or\r\nthirty days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Honor, the horses ran away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, urged by your whip.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was not disorderly, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"The officer declares that you had been drinking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Honor, I got the wrong carriage. My number was seventeen and I\r\nanswered to number seventy-one.\" He wondered if _she_ would believe\r\nthis statement.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that fully explains why you made a race-track of one of our\r\nmain thoroughfares?\"--sarcastically. \"You were on the wrong carriage to\r\nbegin with.\"\r\n\r\n\"All I can say, sir, is that it was a mistake.\"\r\n\r\n\"The mistake came in when you left your carriage to get a drink. You\r\nbroke the law right then. Well, if a man makes mistakes, he must pay\r\nfor them, here or elsewhere. This mistake will cost you thirty-five.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven\u0027t a penny in my clothes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Officer, lock him up, and keep him locked up till the fine is paid. I\r\ncan not see my way to remit it Not another word,\"--as Warburton started\r\nto protest.\r\n\r\n\"Marie Johnson, Mabel Tynner, Belle Lisle!\" cried the clerk.\r\n\r\nThe two veiled ladies left the court precipitately.\r\n\r\nJames, having been ushered into a cell, hurriedly called for pen and\r\nink and paper. At half after ten that morning the following note\r\nreached me:\r\n\r\n\"Dear Chuck: Am in a devil of a scrape at the police-court. Tried to\r\nplay a joke on the girls last night by dressing up in the groom\u0027s\r\nclothes. Got the wrong outfit, and was arrested. Bring thirty-five and\r\na suit of clothes the quickest ever. And, for mercy\u0027s sake, say nothing\r\nto any one, least of all the folks. I have given the name of James\r\nOsborne. Now, hustle. Bob.\"\r\n\r\nI hustled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nANOTHER SALAD IDEA\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they found him missing, his bed untouched, his hat and coat on the\r\nrack, his inseparable walking-stick in the umbrella-stand, they were\r\nmightily worried. They questioned Jane, but she knew nothing. Jack went\r\nout to the stables; no news there. William, having driven the girls\r\nhome himself, dared say nothing. Then Jack wisely telephoned for me,\r\nand I hurried over to the house.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe he hunted up some friends last night,\" I suggested.\r\n\r\n\"But here\u0027s his hat!\" cried Nancy.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he\u0027s all right; don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ll take a tour around the city.\r\nI\u0027ll find him. He may be at one of the clubs.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately for Mr. James Osborne I returned home first, and there\r\nfound his note awaiting me. I was at the court by noon, armed with\r\nthirty-five and a suit of clothes of my own. I found the clerk.\r\n\r\n\"A young man, dressed as a groom, and locked up overnight,\" I said\r\ncautiously. \"I wish to pay his fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"James Osborne?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that\u0027s the name; James Osborne,\"--reaching down into my pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Fine\u0027s just been paid. We were about to release him. Here, officer,\r\nshow this gentleman to James Osborne\u0027s cell, and tell him to pack up\r\nand get out.\"\r\n\r\nSo his fine was paid! Found the money in his clothes, doubtless. On the\r\nway to the cells I wondered what the deuce the rascal had been doing to\r\nget locked up overnight. I was vastly angry, but at the sight of him\r\nall my anger melted into a prolonged shout of laughter.\r\n\r\n\"That\u0027s right; laugh, you old pirate! I wish you had been in my boots a\r\nfew hours ago. Lord!\"\r\n\r\nI laughed again.\r\n\r\n\"Have you got that thirty-five?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Why, your fine has been paid,\" I replied, rather surprised.\r\n\r\n\"And didn\u0027t you pay it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I! The clerk told me that it had just been paid.\"\r\n\r\nWarburton\u0027s jaw sank limply. \"Just been paid?--Who the deuce could have\r\npaid it, or known?\"\r\n\r\n\"First, tell me what you\u0027ve been up to.\"\r\n\r\nHe told me snatches of the exploit as he changed his clothes, and it\r\nwas a question which of us laughed the more. But he didn\u0027t say a word\r\nabout the stolen kiss, for which I think none the less of him.\r\n\r\n\"Who were the women?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me for a space, as if deciding. Finally he made a negative\r\nsign.\r\n\r\n\"Don\u0027t know who they were, eh?\"--incredulously.\r\n\r\nHe shrugged, laughed, and drew on his shoes.\r\n\r\n\"I always knew that I was the jackass of the family, Chuck, but I never\r\nexpected to do it so well. Let\u0027s get out of this hole. I wonder who can\r\nhave paid that fine?... No, that would not be possible!\"\r\n\r\n\"What would not be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, nothing,\"--laughing.\r\n\r\nBut I could see that his spirits had gone up several degrees.\r\n\r\n\"The whole thing is likely to be in the evening papers,\" I said. He\r\nneeded a little worrying. And I knew his horror of publicity.\r\n\r\n\"The newspapers? In the newspapers? Oh, I say, Chuck, can\u0027t you use\r\nyour influence to suppress the thing? Think of the girls.\"\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027ll do the best I can. And there\u0027s only one thing for you to do, and\r\nthat is to cut out of town till your beard has grown. It would serve\r\nyou right, however, if the reporters got the true facts.\"\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027m for getting out of town, Chuck; and on the next train but one.\"\r\n\r\nHere our conversation was interrupted by the entrance of a policeman.\r\n\r\n\"A note for _Mister_ Osborne,\"--ironically. He tossed the letter to\r\nWarburton and withdrew.\r\n\r\n_Mister_ Osborne eagerly tore open an end of the envelope--a very\r\naristocratic envelope, as I could readily discern--and extracted the\r\nletter. I closely watched his facial expressions. First, there was\r\ninterest, then surprise, to be succeeded by amusement and a certain\r\nexultation. He slapped his thigh.\r\n\r\n\"By George, Chuck. I\u0027ll do it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do it? Now what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen to this.\" He cleared his throat, sniffed of the faintly scented\r\npaper and cleared his throat again. He looked up at me drolly.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" said I, impatiently. I was as eager to hear it as he had been\r\nto read it. I believed that the mystery was about to be solved.\r\n\r\n\"\u0027James Osborne, Sir: I have been thinking the matter over seriously,\r\nand have come to the conclusion that there may have been a mistake.\r\nUndoubtedly my groom was primarily to blame. I have discharged him for\r\nneglecting his post of duty. I distinctly recall the manner in which\r\nyou handled the horses last night. It may be possible that they ran\r\naway with you. However that may be, I find myself in need of a groom.\r\nYour horsemanship saved us from a serious accident. If you will promise\r\nto let whisky alone, besides bringing me a recommendation, and are\r\nwithout engagement, call at the inclosed address this afternoon at\r\nthree o\u0027clock. I should be willing to pay as much as forty dollars a\r\nmonth. You would be expected to accompany me on my morning rides.\u0027\"\r\n\r\n\"She must have paid the fine,\" said I. \"Well, it beats anything I ever\r\nheard of. Had you arrested, and now wants to employ you! What name did\r\nyou say?\" I asked carelessly.\r\n\r\n\"I didn\u0027t say any name, Chuck,\"--smiling. \"And I\u0027m not going to give\r\nany, you old duffer.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the one and simple reason that I am going to accept the\r\nposition,\"--with a coolness that staggered me.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" I bawled.\r\n\r\n\"Sure as life, as the policeman said last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"You silly ass, you! Do you want to make the family a laughing-stock\r\nall over town?\" I was really angry.\r\n\r\n\"Neither the family nor the town will know anything about\r\nit,\"--imperturbably.\r\n\r\n\"But you will be recognized!\" I remonstrated. \"It\u0027s a clear case of\r\ninsanity, after what has just happened to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise not to drink any whisky,\"--soberly.\r\n\r\n\"Bob, you are fooling me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the littlest bit, Chuck. I\u0027ve worn a beard for two years. No one\r\nwould recognize me. Besides, being a groom, no one would pay any\r\nparticular attention to me. Get the point?\"\r\n\r\n\"But what under the sun is your object?\" I demanded. \"There\u0027s something\r\nback of all this. It\u0027s not a simple lark like last night\u0027s.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perspicacious man!\"--railingly. \"Possibly you may be right. Chuck, you\r\nknow that I\u0027ve just got to be doing something. I\u0027ve been inactive too\r\nlong. I am ashamed to say that I should tire of the house in a week or\r\nless. Change, change, of air, of place, of occupation; change--I must\r\nhave it. It\u0027s food and drink.\"\r\n\r\n\"You\u0027ve met this woman before, somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"I neither acknowledge nor deny. It will be very novel. I shall be busy\r\nfrom morning till night. Think of the fun of meeting persons whom you\r\nknow, but who do not know you. I wouldn\u0027t give up this chance for any\r\namount of money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forty Dollars a month,\" said I, wrathfully.\r\n\r\n\"Cigar money,\"--tranquilly.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Bob; be reasonable. You can\u0027t go about as a groom in\r\nWashington. If the newspapers ever get hold of it, you would be\r\ndisgraced. They wouldn\u0027t take you as a clerk in a third-rate consulate.\r\nSupposing you should run into Jack or his wife or Nancy; do you think\r\nthey wouldn\u0027t know you at once?\"\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027ll take the risk. I\u0027d deny that I knew them; they\u0027d tumble and leave\r\nme alone. Chuck, I\u0027ve got to do this. Some day you\u0027ll understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the woman\u0027s name, Bob; only her name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes! And have you slide around and show me up within twenty-four\r\nhours. No, I thank you. I am determined on this. You ought to know me\r\nby this time. I never back down; it isn\u0027t in the blood. And when all is\r\nsaid, where\u0027s the harm in this escapade? I can see none. It may not\r\nlast the day through.\"\r\n\r\n\"I trust not,\"--savagely.\r\n\r\n\"I am determined upon answering this letter in person and finding out,\r\nif possible, what induced her to pay my fine. Jackass or not, I\u0027m going\r\nto see the thing through.\" Then he stretched an appealing hand out\r\ntoward me, and said wheedlingly: \"Chuck, give me your word to keep\r\nperfectly quiet. I\u0027ll drop you a line once in a while, just to let you\r\nknow how I stand. I shall be at the house to-night. I\u0027ll find an\r\nexcuse. I\u0027m to go up North on a hunting expedition; a hurry call. Do\r\nyou catch on?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall never be able to look Nancy in the face,\" I declared. \"Come,\r\nBob; forget it. It sounds merry enough, but my word for it, you\u0027ll\r\nregret it inside of twenty-four hours. You are a graduate of the\r\nproudest military school in the world, and you are going to make a\r\ngroom of yourself!\"\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027ve already done that and been locked up overnight. You are wasting\r\nyour breath, Chuck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, hang you for a jackass, sure enough! I promise; but if you get\r\ninto any such scrape as this, you needn\u0027t send for me. I refuse to help\r\nyou again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can\u0027t exactly see that you did. Let\u0027s get out. Got a cigar in your\r\npocket? I am positively dying for a smoke.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly a brilliant idea came to me.\r\n\r\n\"Did you know that Miss Annesley, the girl you saw on shipboard, is in\r\nWashington and was at the embassy last night?\"\r\n\r\n\"No! You don\u0027t say!\" He was too clever for me. \"When I get through with\r\nthis exploit, Nancy\u0027ll have to introduce me. Did you see her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and talked to her. You see what you missed by not going last\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I missed a good night\u0027s rest and a cold bath in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where shall I say you were last night?\" I asked presently.\r\n\r\nMister James scratched his chin disconcertedly. \"I hadn\u0027t thought of\r\nthat. Say that I met some of the boys and got mixed up in a little game\r\nof poker.\"\r\n\r\n\"You left your hat on the rack and your cane in the stand. You are\r\nsupposed to have left the house without any hat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hat!\" He jumped up from the cot on which he had been sitting and\r\npicked up the groom\u0027s tile. \"Didn\u0027t you bring me a hat?\"--dismayed.\r\n\r\n\"You said nothing about it,\"--and I roared with laughter.\r\n\r\n\"How shall I get out of here? I can\u0027t wear this thing through the\r\nstreets.\"\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027ve a mind to make you wear it. And, by Jove, you shall! You\u0027ll wear\r\nit to the hatter\u0027s, or stay here. That\u0027s final. I never back down,\r\neither.\"\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027ll wear it; only, mark me, I\u0027ll get even with you. I always did.\"\r\n\r\n\"_I_ am not a boy any longer,\"--with an inflection on the personal\r\npronoun. \"Well, to continue about that excuse. You left the house\r\nwithout a hat, and you met the boys and played poker all night. That\r\nhitches wonderfully. You didn\u0027t feel well enough to go to the embassy,\r\nbut you could go and play poker. That sounds as if you cared a lot for\r\nyour sister. And you wanted to stay at home the first night, because\r\nyou had almost forgotten how the inside of a private dwelling looked.\r\nVery good; very coherent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cut it, Chuck. What the deuce excuse _can_ I give?\"--worriedly\r\nlighting the cigar I had given him.\r\n\r\n\"My boy, I\u0027m not making up your excuses; you\u0027ll have to invent those.\r\nI\u0027ll be silent, but I refuse to lie to Nancy on your account. Poker is\r\nthe only excuse that would carry any weight with it. You will have to\r\nlet them believe you\u0027re a heartless wretch; which you are, if you\r\npersist in this idiotic exploit.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don\u0027t understand, Chuck. I wish I could tell you; honestly, I do.\r\nThe girls will have to think mean things of me till the farce is over.\r\nI couldn\u0027t escape if I wanted to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it Miss Annesley, Bob? Was it she whom you ran away with? Come,\r\nmake a clean breast of it. If it\u0027s she, why, that altogether alters the\r\nface of things.\"\r\n\r\nHe walked the length of the cell and returned. \"I give up. You\u0027ve hit\r\nit. You understand now. I simply can\u0027t back away; I couldn\u0027t if I\r\ntried.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you in love with the girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"That\u0027s just what I want to find out, Chuck. I\u0027m not sure. I\u0027ve been\r\nthinking of her night and day. I never had any affair; I don\u0027t know\r\nwhat love is. But if it\u0027s shaking in your boots at the sound of her\r\nname, if it\u0027s getting red in the face when you only just think of her,\r\nif it\u0027s having a wild desire to pick her up and run away with her when\r\nyou see her, then I\u0027ve got it. When she stepped out of that confounded\r\ncarriage last night, you could have knocked me over with a paper-wad.\r\nCome, let\u0027s go out. Hang the hat! Let them all laugh if they will. It\u0027s\r\nonly a couple of blocks to the hatter\u0027s.\"\r\n\r\nHe bravely put the white hat on his head, and together we marched out\r\nof the police-office into the street. We entered the nearest hatter\u0027s\r\ntogether. He took what they call a drop-kick out of the hat, sending it\r\nfar to the rear of the establishment. I purchased a suitable derby for\r\nhim, gave him ten dollars for emergencies, and we parted.\r\n\r\nHe proceeded to a telegraph office and sent a despatch to a friend up\r\nNorth, asking him to telegraph him to come at once, taking his chances\r\nof getting a reply. After this he boarded a north-going car, and was\r\nrolled out to Chevy Chase. He had no difficulty in finding the house of\r\nwhich he was in search. It was a fine example of colonial architecture,\r\nwell back from the road, and fields beyond it. It was of red brick and\r\nwhite stone, with a wide veranda supported by great white pillars.\r\nThere was a modern portico at one side. A fine lawn surrounded the\r\nwhole, and white-pebble walks wound in and out. All around were thickly\r\nwooded hills, gashed here and there by the familiar yet peculiar red\r\nclay of the country. Warburton walked up the driveway and knocked\r\ndeliberately at the servants\u0027 door, which was presently opened. (I\r\nlearned all these things afterward, which accounts for my accurate\r\nknowledge of events.)\r\n\r\n\"Please inform Miss Annesley that Mr. Osborne has come in reply to her\r\nletter,\" he said to the little black-eyed French maid.\r\n\r\n\"Ees Meestaire Osborrrrne zee new groom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I go thees minute!\" _Hein!_ what a fine-looking young man to make eyes\r\nat on cold nights in the kitchen!\r\n\r\nWarburton sat down and twirled his hat. Several times he repressed the\r\ndesire to laugh. He gazed curiously about him. From where he sat he\r\ncould see into the kitchen. The French chef was hanging up his polished\r\npans in a glistening row back of the range, and he was humming a little\r\n_chanson_ which Warburton had often heard in the restaurants of the\r\nprovincial cities of France. He even found himself catching up the\r\nrefrain where the chef left off. Presently he heard footsteps sounding\r\non the hardwood floor, which announced that the maid was returning with\r\nher mistress.\r\n\r\nHe stood up, rested first on one foot, then on the other, and awkwardly\r\nshifted his new hat from one hand to the other, then suddenly put the\r\nhat under his arm, recollecting that the label was not such as servants\r\nwore inside their hats.\r\n\r\nThere was something disquieting in those magnetic sapphire eyes looking\r\nso serenely into his.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHE HEROINE HIRES A GROOM\r\n\r\n\r\nRemarkable as it may read, his first impression was of her gown--a gown\r\nsuch as women wear on those afternoons when they are free of social\r\nobligations, a gown to walk in or to lounge in. The skirt, which barely\r\nreached to the top of her low shoes, was of some blue stuff (stuff,\r\nbecause to a man\u0027s mind the word covers feminine dress-goods generally,\r\nliberally, and handily), overshot with gray. Above this she had put on\r\na white golfing-sweater, a garment which at that time was just\r\nbeginning to find vogue among women who loved the fields and the road.\r\nOnly men who own to stylish sisters appreciate these things, and\r\nWarburton possessed rather observant eyes. She held a bunch of freshly\r\nplucked poppies in her hand. It was the second time that their glances\r\nhad met and held. In the previous episode (on the day she had leaned\r\nout of the cab) hers had been first to fall. Now it was his turn. He\r\nstudied the tips of his shoes. There were three causes why he lowered\r\nhis eyes: First, she was mistress here and he was an applicant for\r\nemployment; second, he loved her; third, he was committing the first\r\nbold dishonesty in his life. Once, it was on the very tip of his tongue\r\nto confess everything, apologize, and take himself off. But his\r\ncuriosity was of greater weight than his desire. He remained silent and\r\nwaited for her to speak.\r\n\r\n\"Celeste, you may leave us,\" said Miss Annesley.\r\n\r\nCeleste courtesied, shot a killing glance at the tentative groom, and\r\ndeparted the scene.\r\n\r\n\"You have driven horses for some length of time?\" the girl began.\r\n\r\nIf only he might look as calmly and fearlessly at her! What a voice,\r\nnow that he heard it in its normal tone! \"Yes, Madam; I have ridden and\r\ndriven something like ten years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the West, mostly.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are English?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Madam.\" He wondered how much she had heard at the police-court\r\nthat morning. \"I am American born.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you addicted to the use of intoxicants?\"--mentally noting the\r\nclearness of the whites of his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe barest flicker of a smile stirred his lips.\r\n\r\n\"No, Madam. I had not been drinking last night--that is, not in the\r\nsense the officers declared I had. It is true that I take a drink once\r\nin a while, when I have been riding or driving all day, or when I am\r\ncold. I have absolutely no appetite.\"\r\n\r\nShe brushed her cheeks with the poppies, and for a brief second the\r\nflowers threw a most beautiful color over her face and neck.\r\n\r\n\"What was your object in climbing on the box of my carriage and running\r\naway with it?\"\r\n\r\nQuick as a flash of light he conceived his answer. \"Madam, it was a\r\njest between me and some maids.\" He had almost said serving-maids, but\r\nthe thought of Nancy checked this libel.\r\n\r\n\"Between you and some maids?\"--faintly contemptuous. \"Explain, for I\r\nbelieve an explanation is due me.\"\r\n\r\nHis gaze was forced to rove again. \"Well, Madam, it is truly\r\nembarrassing. Two maids were to enter a carriage and I was to drive\r\nthem away from the embassy, and once I had them in the carriage I\r\nthought it would be an admirable chance to play them a trick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray, since when have serving-maids beein allowed exit from the main\r\nhall of the British embassy?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Robert was positive that the shadow of a sarcastic smile rested for\r\na moment on her lips. But it was instantly hidden under the poppies.\r\n\r\n\"That is something of which I have no intimate knowledge. A groom is\r\nnot supposed to turn his head when on the box unless spoken to. You\r\nwill readily understand that, Madam. I made a mistake in the number.\r\nMine was seventy-one, and I answered number seventeen. I was confused.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say. Seventy-one,\" she mused, \"It will be easy to verify this,\r\nto find out whose carriage that was.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Robert recognized his mistake, but he saw no way to rectify it. She\r\nstood silently gazing over his shoulder, into the fields beyond.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you can explain to me that remarkable episode at the carriage\r\ndoor? I should be pleased to hear your explanation.\"\r\n\r\nIt hard come,--the very thing he had dreaded had come. He had hoped\r\nthat she would ignore it. \"Madam, I can see that you have sent for me\r\nout of curiosity only. If I offered any disrespect to you last night, I\r\npray you to forgive me. For, on my word of honor, it was innocently\r\ndone.\" He bowed, and even placed his hand on the knob of the door.\r\n\r\n\"Have a little patience. I prefer myself to forget that disagreeable\r\nincident.\" The truth is, \"on my word of honor,\" coming from a groom,\r\nsounded strange in her ears; and she wanted to learn more about this\r\nfellow. \"Mr. Osborne, what were you before you became a groom?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not always been a groom, it is true, Madam. My past I prefer to\r\nleave in obscurity. There is nothing in that past, however, of which I\r\nneed be ashamed;\"--and unconsciously his figure became more erect.\r\n\r\n\"Is your name Osborne?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Madam, it is not. For my family\u0027s sake, I have tried to forget my\r\nown name.\" (I\u0027ll wager the rascal never felt a qualm in the region of\r\nhis conscience.)\r\n\r\nIt was this truth which was not truth that won his battle.\r\n\r\n\"You were doubtless discharged last night?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not return to ascertain, Madam. I merely sent for my belongings.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have recommendations?\"--presently.\r\n\r\n\"I have no recommendations whatever, Madam. If you employ me, it must\r\nbe done on your own responsibility and trust in human nature. I can\r\nonly say, Madam, that I am honest, that I am willing, that I possess a\r\nthorough knowledge of horse-flesh.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very unusual,\" she said, searching him to the very heart with\r\nher deep blue eyes. \"For all I know you may be the greatest rascal, or\r\nyou may be the honestest man, in the world.\" His smile was so frank and\r\nengaging that she was forced to smile herself. But she thought of\r\nsomething, and frowned. \"If you have told me the truth, so much the\r\nbetter; for I can easily verify all you have told me. I will give you a\r\nweek\u0027s trial. After all,\"--indifferently--\"what I desire is a capable\r\nservant. You will have to put up with a good deal. There are days when\r\nI am not at all amiable, and on those days I do not like to find a\r\nspeck of rust on the metals or a blanket that has not been thoroughly\r\nbrushed. As for the animals, they must always shine like satin. This\r\nlast is unconditional. Besides all this, our force of servants is\r\nsmall. Do you know anything about serving?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very little.\" What was coming now?\r\n\r\n\"The chef will coach you. I entertain some, and there will be times\r\nwhen you will be called upon to wait on the table. Come with me and I\r\nwill show you the horses. We have only five, but my father takes great\r\npride in them. They are all thoroughbreds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like their mistress,\" was Warburton\u0027s mental supplementary.\r\n\r\n\"Father hasn\u0027t ridden for years, however. The groom I discharged this\r\nmorning was capable enough on the box, but he was worse than useless to\r\nme in my morning rides. I ride from nine till eleven, even Sundays\r\nsometimes. Remain here till I return.\"\r\n\r\nAs she disappeared Warburton drew in an exceedingly long breath and\r\nreleased it slowly. Heavens, what an ordeal! He drew the back of his\r\nhand across his forehead and found it moist. Not a word about the fine:\r\nhe must broach it and thank her. Ah, to ride with her every morning, to\r\nadjust her stirrup, to obey every command to which she might give\r\nvoice, to feel her small boot repulse his palm as she mounted! Heaven\r\ncould hold nothing greater than this. And how easily a woman may be\r\nimposed upon! Decidedly, Mr. Robert was violently in love.\r\n\r\nWhen she returned there was a sunbonnet on her head, and she had pinned\r\nthe poppies on her breast. (Why? I couldn\u0027t tell you, unless when all\r\nis said and done, be he king or valet, a man is always a man; and if\r\nperchance he is blessed with good looks, a little more than a man. You\r\nwill understand that in this instance I am trying to view things\r\nthrough a woman\u0027s eyes.) With a nod she bade him precede her, and they\r\nwent out toward the stables. She noted the flat back, the square\r\nshoulders, the easy, graceful swing of the legs.\r\n\r\n\"Have you been a soldier?\" she asked suddenly.\r\n\r\nHe wheeled. His astonishment could not be disguised quickly enough to\r\nescape her vigilant eyes. Once more he had recourse to the truth.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Madam. It was as a trooper that I learned horsemanship.\"\r\n\r\n\"What regiment?\"\r\n\r\n\"I prefer not to say,\"--quietly.\r\n\r\n\"I do not like mysteries,\"--briefly.\r\n\r\n\"Madam, you have only to dismiss me, to permit me to thank you for\r\npaying my fine and to reimburse you at the earliest opportunity.\"\r\n\r\nShe closed her lips tightly. No one but herself knew what had been on\r\nthe verge of passing across them.\r\n\r\n\"Let us proceed to the stables,\" was all she said. \"If you prove\r\nyourself a capable horseman, that is all I desire.\"\r\n\r\nThe stable-boy slid back the door, and the two entered. Warburton\r\nglanced quickly about; all was neatness. There was light and\r\nventilation, too, and the box-stalls were roomy. The girl stopped\r\nbefore a handsome bay mare, which whinnied when it saw her. She laid\r\nher cheek against the animal\u0027s nose and talked that soft jargon so\r\nembarrassing to man and so intelligible to babies and pet animals.\r\nLucky horse! he thought; but his face expressed nothing.\r\n\r\n\"This is Jane, my own horse, and there are few living things I love so\r\nwell. Remember this. She is a thoroughbred, a first-class hunter; and I\r\nhave done more than five feet on her at home.\"\r\n\r\nShe moved on, Warburton following soberly and thoughtfully. There was a\r\ngood deal to think of just now. The more he saw of this girl, the less\r\nhe understood her purpose in hiring him. She couldn\u0027t possibly know\r\nanything about him, who or what he was. With his beard gone he defied\r\nher to recognize in him the man who had traveled across the Atlantic\r\nwith her. A highbred woman, such as she was, would scarcely harbor any\r\nkind feelings toward a man who had acted as he was acting. If any man\r\nhad kissed Nancy the way he had kissed her, he would have broken every\r\nbone in his body or hired some one to do it. And she had paid his fine\r\nat the police-station and had hired him on probation! Truly he was in\r\nthe woods, and there wasn\u0027t a sign of a blazed trail. (It will be seen\r\nthat my hero hadn\u0027t had much experience with women. She knew nothing of\r\nhim whatever. She was simply curious, and brave enough to attempt to\r\nhave this curiosity gratified. Of course, I do not venture to say that,\r\nhad he been coarse in appearance, she would have had anything to do\r\nwith him.)\r\n\r\n\"This is Dick, my father\u0027s horse,\"--nodding toward a sorrel, large and\r\nwell set-up. \"He will be your mount. The animal in the next stall is\r\nPirate.\"\r\n\r\nPirate was the handsomest black gelding Warburton had ever laid eyes on.\r\n\r\n\"What a beauty!\" he exclaimed enthusiastically, forgetting that grooms\r\nshould be utterly without enthusiasm. He reached out his hand to pat\r\nthe black nose, when a warning cry restrained him. Pirate\u0027s ears lay\r\nflat.\r\n\r\n\"Take care! He is a bad-tempered animal. No one rides him, and we keep\r\nhim only to exhibit at the shows. Only half a dozen men have ridden him\r\nwith any success. He won\u0027t take a curb in his mouth, and he always runs\r\naway. It takes a very strong man to hold him in. I really don\u0027t believe\r\nthat he\u0027s vicious, only terribly mischievous, like a bullying boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like to ride him.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl looked at her new groom in a manner which expressed frank\r\nastonishment. Was he in earnest, or was it mere bravado? An idea came\r\nto her, a mischievous idea.\r\n\r\n\"If you can sit on Pirate\u0027s back for ten minutes, there will not be any\r\nquestion of probation. I promise to engage you on the spot,\r\nrecommendation or no recommendation.\" Would he, back down?\r\n\r\n\"Where are the saddles, Madam?\" he asked calmly, though his blood moved\r\nfaster.\r\n\r\n\"On the pegs behind you,\"--becoming interested. \"Do you really intend\r\nto ride him?\"\r\n\r\n\"With your permission.\"\r\n\r\n\"I warn you that the risk you are running is great.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not afraid of Pirate, Madam,\" in a tone which implied that he was\r\nnot afraid of any horse living. The spirit of antagonism rose up in\r\nhim, that spirit of antagonism of the human against the animal, that\r\neternal ambition of the one to master the other. And besides, I\u0027m not\r\nsure that James didn\u0027t want to show off before the girl--another very\r\nhuman trait in mankind. For my part, I wouldn\u0027t give yesterday\u0027s rose\r\nfor a man who wouldn\u0027t show off once in a while, when his best girl is\r\naround and looking on.\r\n\r\n\"On your head be it, then,\"--a sudden nervousness seizing her. Yet she\r\nwas as eager to witness the encounter as he was to court it. \"William!\"\r\nshe called. The stable-boy entered, setting aside his broom. \"This is\r\nJames, the new groom. Help him to saddle Pirate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Saddle Pirate, Miss Annesley!\" cried the boy, his mouth open and his\r\neyes wide.\r\n\r\n\"You see?\" said the girl to Warburton.\r\n\r\n\"Take down that saddle with the hooded stirrups,\" said Warburton,\r\nbriefly. He would ride Pirate now, even if Pirate had been sired in\r\nBeelzebub\u0027s stables. He carefully inspected the saddle, the\r\nstirrup-straps and the girth. \"Very good, indeed. Buckles on saddles\r\nare always a hidden menace and a constant danger. Now, bring out\r\nPirate, William.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam brought out the horse, who snorted when he saw the saddle on\r\nthe floor and the curb on Warburton\u0027s arm.\r\n\r\n\"There hasn\u0027t been anybody on his back for a year, sir; not since last\r\nwinter. He\u0027s likely to give you trouble,\" said the boy. \"You can\u0027t put\r\nthat curb on him, sir; he won\u0027t stand for it a moment. Miss Annesley,\r\nhadn\u0027t you better step outside? He may start to kicking. That heavy\r\nEnglish snaffle is the best thing I know of. Try that, sir. And don\u0027t\r\nlet him get his head down, or he\u0027ll do you. Whoa!\" as Pirate suddenly\r\ntook it into his head to leave the barn without any one\u0027s permission.\r\n\r\nThe girl sprang lightly into one of the empty stalls and waited. She\r\nwas greatly excited, and the color in her cheeks was not borrowed from\r\nthe poppies. She saw the new groom take Pirate by the forelock, and,\r\nquicker than words can tell, Mr. Pirate was angrily champing the cold\r\nbit. He reared. Warburton caught him by the nose and the neck. Pirate\r\ncame down, trembling with rage.\r\n\r\n\"Here, boy; catch him here,\" cried Warburton. William knew his\r\nbusiness, and he grasped the bridle close under Pirate\u0027s jaws. \"That\u0027s\r\nit. Now hold him.\"\r\n\r\nWarburton picked up the saddle and threw it over Pirate\u0027s glossy back.\r\nPirate waltzed from side to side, and shook his head wickedly. But the\r\nman that was to mount him knew all these signs. Swiftly he gathered up\r\nthe end of the belly-band strap and ran it through the iron ring. In\r\nand out he threaded it, drawing it tighter and tighter. He leaped into\r\nthe saddle and adjusted the stirrups, then dismounted.\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027ll take him now, William,\" said James, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"All right, sir,\" said William, glad enough to be relieved of all\r\nfurther responsibility.\r\n\r\nJames led Pirate into the small court and waited for Miss Annesley, who\r\nappeared in the doorway presently.\r\n\r\n\"James, I regret that I urged you to ride him. You will be hurt,\" she\r\nsaid. Her worry was plainly visible on her face.\r\n\r\nJames smiled his pleasantest and touched his hat.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then; I have warned you. If he bolts, head him for a tree.\r\nThat\u0027s the only way to stop him.\"\r\n\r\nJames shortened the bridle-rein to the required length, took a firm\r\ngrip on Pirate\u0027s mane, and vaulted into the saddle. Pirate stood\r\nperfectly still. He shook his head. James talked to him and patted his\r\nsleek neck, and touched him gently with his heel. Then things livened\r\nup a bit. Pirate waltzed, reared, plunged, and started to do the _pas\r\nseul_ on the flower-beds. Then he immediately changed his mind. He\r\ndecided to re-enter the stables.\r\n\r\n\"Don\u0027t let him get his head down!\" yelled William, nimbly jumping over\r\na bed of poppies and taking his position beside his mistress.\r\n\r\n\"The gates, William! The gates!\" cried the girl, excitedly. \"Only one\r\nis open. He will not be able to get through.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam scampered down the driveway and swung back the iron barrier.\r\nNone too soon! Like a black shadow, Pirate flashed by, his rider\u0027s new\r\nderby rolling in the dust.\r\n\r\nThe girl stood in the doorway, her hands pressed against her heart. She\r\nwas as white as the clouds that sailed overhead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nPIRATE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the road there was a stone wall about five feet\r\nin height; beyond this was a broad, rolling field, and farther on, a\r\nbarb-wire fence and a boggy stream which oozed its way down toward the\r\nPotomac. Far away across the valley the wooded hills were drying and\r\nwithering and thinning, with splashes of yellow and red. A flock of\r\nbirds speckled the fleecy October clouds, and a mild breeze sent the\r\ngrasses shivering.\r\n\r\nToward the wall Pirate directed his course. Warburton threw back his\r\nfull weight. The effort had little or no effect on Pirate\u0027s mouth. His\r\nrider remembered about the tree, but the nearest was many yards away.\r\nOver the wall they went, and down the field. Pirate tried to get his\r\nhead down, but he received a check. Score one for the man. Warburton,\r\nhis legs stiffened in the stirrups, his hands well down, his breath\r\ncoming in gasps, wondered where they would finally land. He began to\r\nuse his knees, and Pirate felt the pressure. He didn\u0027t like it at all.\r\nOddly enough, Warburton\u0027s leg did not bother him as he expected it\r\nwould, and this gave him confidence. On, on; the dull pounding of\r\nPirate\u0027s feet, the flying sod, the wind in his face: and when he saw\r\nthe barb-wire fence, fear entered into him. An inch too low, a stumble,\r\nand serious injuries might result. He must break Pirate\u0027s gait.\r\n\r\nHe began to saw cow-boy fashion. Pirate grew very indignant: he was\r\nbeing hurt. His speed slackened none, however; he was determined to\r\nmake that fence if it was the last thing he ever did. He\u0027d like to see\r\nany man stop him. He took the deadly fence as with the wings of a bird.\r\nBut he found that the man was still on his back. He couldn\u0027t understand\r\nit. He grew worried. And then he struck the red-brown muck bordering\r\nthe stream. The muck flew, but at every bound Pirate sank deeper, and\r\nthe knees of his rider were beginning to tell. Warburton, full of rage,\r\nyet not unreasonable rage, quickly saw his chance. Once more he threw\r\nback his weight; this time to the left. Pirate\u0027s head came stubbornly\r\naround; his gait was broken, he was floundering in the stream. Now\r\nWarburton used his heels savagely. He shortened the reins and whacked\r\nMr. Pirate soundly across the ears. Pirate plunged and reared and,\r\nafter devious evolutions, reached solid ground. This time his head was\r\nhigh in the air, and, try as he would, he could not lower his neck a\r\nsolitary inch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"He\u0027s a newspaper man and makes his living by telling\r\nlies.\"--ACT II.]\r\n\r\nWarburton knew that the animal could not make the barb-wire fence\r\nagain, so he waltzed him along till he found a break in the wire. Over\r\nthis Pirate bounded, snorting. But he had met a master. Whether he\r\nreared or plunged, waltzed or ran, he could not make those ruthless\r\nknees relent in their pressure. He began to understand what all beasts\r\nunderstand, sooner or later--the inevitable mastery of man. There was\r\nblood in his nostrils. A hand touched his neck caressingly. He shook\r\nhis head; he refused to conciliate. A voice, kindly but rather\r\nbreathless, addressed him. Again Pirate shook his head; but he did not\r\nrun, he cantered. Warburton gave a sigh of relief. Over the field they\r\nwent. A pull to the left, and Pirate wheeled; a pull to the right, and\r\nagain Pirate answered, and cantered in a circle. But he still shook his\r\nhead discontentedly, and the froth that spattered Warburton\u0027s legs was\r\nflecked with blood. The stirrup-strap began to press sharply and\r\nhurtfully against Warburton\u0027s injured leg. He tugged, and Pirate fell\r\ninto a trot. He was mastered.\r\n\r\nAfter this Warburton did as he pleased; Pirate had learned his lesson.\r\nHis master put him through a dozen manoeuvers, and he was vastly\r\nsatisfied with the victory. In the heat of the battle Warburton had\r\nforgotten all about where and what he was; and it was only when he\r\ndiscerned far away a sunbonnet with fluttering strings peering over the\r\nstone wall, and a boy in leggings standing on top of the wall, that he\r\nrecollected. A wave of exhilaration swept through his veins. He had\r\nconquered the horse before the eyes of the one woman.\r\n\r\nHe guided Pirate close to the wall, and stopped him, looked down into\r\nthe girl\u0027s wonder-lit eyes and smiled cheerfully. And what is more, she\r\nsmiled faintly in acknowledgment. He had gained, in the guise of a\r\ngroom, what he might never have gained in any other condition of life,\r\nthe girl\u0027s respect and admiration. Though a thorough woman of the\r\nworld, high-bred, wellborn, she forgot for the moment to control her\r\nfeatures; and as I have remarked elsewhere, Warburton was a shrewd\r\nobserver.\r\n\r\n\"Bully, Mr. Osborne!\" shouted William, leaping down. \"It was simply\r\ngreat!\"\r\n\r\n\"There are some bars farther down,\" said the girl, quietly. \"William,\r\nrun and open them.\"\r\n\r\nWarburton flushed slightly. He could not tell how she had accomplished\r\nit, whether it was the tone or the gesture, but she had calmly\r\nreestablished the barrier between mistress and servant.\r\n\r\n\"I think I\u0027ll put him to the wall again,\" said the hero, seized by a\r\nrebel spirit.\r\n\r\nHe wheeled Pirate about and sent him back at a run. Pirate balked.\r\nRound he went again, down the field and back. This time he cleared the\r\nwall with a good foot to spare. The victory was complete.\r\n\r\nWhen it was all over, and Pirate was impatiently munching an extra\r\nsupply of oats, the girl bade Mr. James to report early the following\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n\"I hope I shall please you, Madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Address me as Miss Annesley from now on,\" she said; and nodding\r\nshortly, she entered the house.\r\n\r\nTo Warburton, half the pleasure of the victory was gone; for not a word\r\nof praise had she given him. Yet, she had answered his smile. Well, he\r\nhad made a lackey out of himself; he had no right to expect anything\r\nbut forty dollars a month and orders.\r\n\r\nHe broke his word with me. He did not return to the house that night\r\nfor dinner. In fact, he deliberately sent for his things, explaining\r\nthat he was called North and wouldn\u0027t have time to see them before he\r\nleft. It took all my persuasive oratory to smooth the troubled waters,\r\nand then there were areas upon which my oil had no effect whatever.\r\n\r\n\"He is perfectly heartless!\" cried Nancy. \"He couldn\u0027t go to the\r\nembassy, but he could steal away and play poker all night with a lot of\r\nidling Army officers. And now he is going off to Canada without even\r\nseeing us to say good-by. Charlie, there is something back of all this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027ll bet it\u0027s a woman,\" said Jack, throwing a scrutinizing glance at\r\nme. But I was something of a diplomat myself, and he didn\u0027t catch me\r\nnapping. \"Here\u0027s a telegram for him, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I\u0027ll take the liberty of opening it,\" said I. I knew its\r\ncontents. It was the reply Warburton had depended on. I read it aloud.\r\nIt is good to have friends of this sort. No question was asked. It was\r\na bald order: \"Come up at once and shoot caribou. Take first train.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bob\u0027s a jackass,\" was Jack\u0027s commentary. I had heard something like it\r\nbefore, that day. \"He\u0027ll turn up all right;\"--and Jack lit a cigar and\r\npicked up his paper.\r\n\r\n\"And Betty Annesley is going to call to-morrow night,\" said Nancy, her\r\nvoice overflowing with reproach. Her eyes even sparkled with tears. \"I\r\ndid so want them to meet.\"\r\n\r\nI called myself a villain. But I had given my promise; and I was in\r\nlove myself.\r\n\r\n\"I don\u0027t see what we can do. When Bob makes up his mind to do anything,\r\nhe generally does it.\" Jack, believing he had demolished the subject,\r\nopened his _Morning Post_ and fell to studying the latest phases of the\r\nVenezuelan muddle.\r\n\r\nNancy began to cry softly; she loved the scalawag as only sisters know\r\nhow to love. And I became possessed with two desires; to console her\r\nand to punch Mr. Robert\u0027s head.\r\n\r\n\"It has always been this way with him,\" Nancy went on, dabbing her eyes\r\nwith her two-by-four handkerchief. \"We never dreamed that he was going\r\ninto the Army till he came home one night and announced that he had\r\nsuccessfully passed his examinations for West Point. He goes and gets\r\nshot, and we never know anything about it till we read the papers.\r\nNext, he resigns and goes abroad without a word or coming to see us. I\r\ndon\u0027t know what to make of Bobby; I really don\u0027t.\"\r\n\r\nI took her hand in mine and kissed it, and told her the rascal would\r\nturn up in due time, that they hadn\u0027t heard the last of him for that\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n\"He\u0027s only thoughtless and single-purposed,\" interposed Jack.\r\n\r\n\"Single-purposed!\" I echoed.\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes. He gets one thing at a time in his brain, and thinks of\r\nnothing else till that idea is worn out. I know him.\"\r\n\r\nI recalled my useless persuasion of the morning. \"I believe you are\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I\u0027m right,\" replied Jack, turning a page of his paper. \"Do\r\n_you_ know where he has gone?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think the telegram explains everything,\"--evasively.\r\n\r\n\"Humph! Don\u0027t you worry about him, Nan. I\u0027ll wager he\u0027s up to some of\r\nhis old-time deviltry.\"\r\n\r\nThese and other little observations Jack let fall made it plain to me\r\nthat he was a natural student of men and their impulses, and that his\r\ninsight and judgment, unerring and anticipatory, had put him where he\r\nis to-day, at the head of a department.\r\n\r\nI left the house about ten o\u0027clock, went downtown and found the\r\nprodigal at a cheap hotel on Pennsylvania. He was looking over some\r\nboots and leggings and ready-made riding breeches.\r\n\r\n\"Aha, Chuck, so here you are!\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Bob, this will never do at all,\" I began.\r\n\r\n\"I thought we had threshed all that out thoroughly this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"I left Nancy crying over your blamed callousness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nancy? Hang it, I don\u0027t want Nancy to waste any tears over me; I\u0027m not\r\nworth it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precious little you care! If it wasn\u0027t for the fact that you have told\r\nme the true state of things, I should have exposed you to-night. Why\r\ndidn\u0027t you turn up to dinner as you promised? You might at least have\r\ngone through the pretense of saying good-by to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear boy, I\u0027ll admit that my conduct is nefarious. But look; Nancy\r\nknows Miss Annesley, and they will be calling on each other. The truth\r\nis, I dare not let the girls see me without a beard. And I\u0027m too far\r\ngone into the thing to back out now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I honestly hope that some one recognizes you and gives you away,\" I\r\ndeclared indignantly.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks. You\u0027re in love with Nancy, aren\u0027t you? To be sure. Well,\r\nwouldn\u0027t you do anything to keep around where she is, to serve her, to\r\nhear her voice, to touch her hand occasionally, to ride with her; in\r\nfact, always to be within the magic circle of her presence? Well, I\r\nlove this girl; I know it now, it is positive, doubtless. Her presence\r\nis as necessary to me as the air I breathe. Had I met her in the\r\nconventional way, she would have looked upon me as one of the pillars\r\nof convention, and mildly ignored me. As I am, she does not know what I\r\nam, or who I am; I am a mystery, I represent a secret, and she desires\r\nto find out what this secret is. Besides all this, something impels me\r\nto act this part, something aside from love. It is inexplicable; fate,\r\nmaybe.\" He paused, went to the window, and looked down into the street.\r\nIt was after-theater time and carriages were rolling to and fro.\r\n\r\n\"Bob, I apologize. You know a great deal more about feminine nature\r\nthan I had given you credit for. But how can you win her this way?\"\r\n\r\nHe raised his shoulders. \"Time and chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, whate\u0027er betide, I can\u0027t help wishing you luck.\"\r\n\r\nWe shook hands silently, and then I left him.\r\n\r\n\"Father,\" said Betty Annesley at the dinnertable that same night, \"I\r\nhave engaged a new groom. He rode Pirate to-day and thoroughly mastered\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pirate? You don\u0027t say! Well, I\u0027m glad of that. Pirate will make a\r\ncapital saddle-horse if he is ridden often enough. The groom will be a\r\nsafe companion for you on your rides. Are you too tired to do some\r\ndrawing for me to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"The fortification plans?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\" His eyes wandered from her face to the night outside. How gray\r\nand sad the world was! \"You will always love your father, dearie?\"\r\n\r\n\"Love him? Always!\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever betide, for weal or woe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever betide.\"\r\n\r\nHow easy it was for her to say these words!\r\n\r\n\"And yet, some day, you must leave me, to take up your abode in some\r\nother man\u0027s heart. My only wish is that it may beat for you as truly as\r\nmine does.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not reply, but stepped to the window and pressed her brow to\r\nthe chilled pane. A yellow and purple line marked the path of the\r\nvanished sun; the million stars sparkled above; far away she could see\r\nthe lights of the city. Of what was she thinking, dreaming? Was she\r\ndreaming of heroes such as we poets and novelists invent and hang upon\r\nthe puppet-beam? Ah, the pity of these dreams the young girl has! She\r\ndreams of heroes and of god-like men, and of the one that is to come.\r\nBut, ah! he never comes, he never comes; and the dream fades and dies,\r\nand the world becomes real. A man may find his ideal, but a woman,\r\nnever. To youth, the fields of love; to man, the battle-ground; to old\r\nage, a chair in the sunshine and the wreck of dreams!\r\n\r\n\"The government ought to pay you well if those plans are successful.\"\r\nShe moved away from the window.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the government ought to pay me well. I should like to make you\r\nrich, dearie, and happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, daddy, am I not both? I have more money than I know what to do\r\nwith, and I am happy in having the kindest father.\" She came around the\r\ntable and caressed him, cheek to cheek. \"Money isn\u0027t everything. It\r\njust makes me happy to do anything for you.\"\r\n\r\nHis arm grew tense around her waist.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what was running through my mind at the embassy last\r\nnight? I was thinking how deeply I love this great wide country of\r\nmine. As I looked at the ambassador and his aides, I was saying to\r\nmyself, \u0027You dare not!\u0027 It may have been silly, but I couldn\u0027t help it,\r\nWe are the greatest people in the world. When I compared foreign\r\nsoldiers with our own, how my heart and pride swelled! No formalities,\r\nno race prejudice, no false pride. I was never introduced to a foreign\r\nofficer that I did not fear him, with his weak eyes, his affected\r\nmannerisms, his studied rudeness, not to me, but to the country I\r\nrepresented. How I made some of them dance! Not for vanity\u0027s sake;\r\nrather the inborn patriotism of my race. I had only to think of my\r\nfather, his honorable scars, his contempt for little things, his\r\ncourage, his steadfastness, his love for his country, which has so\r\nhonored him with its trust. Oh! I am a patriot; and I shall never,\r\nnever marry a man whose love for his country does not equal my own.\"\r\nShe caught up her father\u0027s mutilated hand and kissed it. \"And even now\r\nthis father of mine is planning and planning to safeguard his country.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you must not say anything to a soul, my child; it must be a secret\r\ntill all is ready. I met Karloff to-day at the club. He has promised to\r\ndine with us to-morrow night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make him postpone it. I have promised to dine with Nancy Warburton.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had better dine with us and spend the evening with your friend. Do\r\nyou not think him a handsome fellow?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is charming.\" She touched the bowl of poppies with her fingers and\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\n\"He is very wealthy, too.\"\r\n\r\nBetty offered no comment.\r\n\r\n\"What did they do to that infernal rascal who attempted to run away\r\nwith you and Mrs. Chadwick?\"\r\n\r\n\"They arrested him and locked him up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope they will keep him there. And what reason did he give the\r\npolice for attempting to run away with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"He said that he had made a wager with some serving-maids to drive them\r\nfrom the embassy. He claims to have got the wrong number and the wrong\r\ncarriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"A very likely story!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a very likely story!\"--and Betty, still smiling, passed on into\r\nthe music-room, where she took her violin from its case and played some\r\nrollicking measures from Offenbach.\r\n\r\nAt the same time her father rose and went out on the lawn, where he\r\nwalked up and down, with a long, quick, nervous stride. From time to\r\ntime a wailing note from the violin floated out to him, and he would\r\nstop and raise his haggard face toward heaven. His face was no longer\r\nmasked in smiles; it was grief-stricken, self-abhorring. At length he\r\nsoftly crossed the lawn and stood before the music-room window. Ah, no\r\nfretting care sat on yonder exquisite face, nor pain, nor trouble;\r\nyouth, only youth and some pleasant thought which the music had\r\naroused. How like her mother! How like her mother!\r\n\r\nSuddenly he smote himself on the brow with a clenched hand. \"Wretch!\r\nGod-forsaken wretch, how have you kept your trust? And how yonder child\r\nhas stabbed you! How innocently she has stabbed you! My country! ... My\r\nhonor! ... My courage and steadfastness! Mockery!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST RIDE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning Warburton was shown into a neat six-by-eight, just off\r\nthe carriage-room. There was a cot, running water and a wash-stand, and\r\na boot-blacking apparatus. For the rest, there were a few portraits of\r\nfast horses, fighters, and toe-dancers (the adjective qualifying all\r\nthree!) which the senator\u0027s sporting groom had collected and tacked to\r\nthe walls. For appearance\u0027s sake, Mr. James had purchased a cheap\r\ntrunk. Everything inside was new, too. His silver military brushes, his\r\nsilver shaving set, and so forth and so forth, were in charge of a\r\nsafe-deposit storage company, alongside some one\u0027s family jewels. The\r\nonly incriminating things he retained were his signet-ring and his\r\nSwiss timepiece.\r\n\r\n\"Have you had your breakfast, sir?\" asked William, the stable-boy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my lad. Now, as Miss Annesley has forgotten it, perhaps you will\r\ntell me of just what my duties here will consist.\"\r\n\r\n\"You harness, ride and drive, sir, and take care of the metals. I clean\r\nthe leathers and carriages, exercise the horses and keep their hides\r\nshiny. If anything is purchased, sir, we shall have to depend upon your\r\njudgment. Are you given to cussing, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cussing?\" repeated Warburton.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. Miss Annesley won\u0027t stand for it around the stables. The man\r\nbefore you, sir, could cuss most beautifully; and I think that\u0027s why he\r\nwas fired. At least, it was one reason.\"\r\n\r\nWarburton smoothed his twitching mouth. \"Don\u0027t you worry, William; it\u0027s\r\nagainst my religion to use profane language.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam winked, there was an answering wink, and the two became friends\r\nfrom that moment on.\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027ll bet you didn\u0027t say a thing to Pirate yesterday, when he bolted\r\nover the wall with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I believe I _did_ address a few remarks to Pirate which would\r\nnot sound well on dress-parade; but so long as it wasn\u0027t within hearing\r\ndistance, William, I suppose it doesn\u0027t matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; I suppose not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, what kind of a master is the colonel?\" asked Warburton, strapping\r\non his English leggings.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it\u0027s hard to say just now. You see, I\u0027ve been with the family\r\never since I was six. The colonel used to be the best fellow _I_ ever\r\nknew. Always looking out for your comfort, never an undeserved harsh\r\nword, and always a smile when you pleased him. But he\u0027s changed in the\r\nlast two years.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"He doesn\u0027t take any interest in the things he used to. He goes about\r\nas if he had something on his mind; kind of absent-minded, you know;\r\nand forgets to-morrow what he says to-day. He always puts on a good\r\nface, though, when Miss Betty is around.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah. What night do I have off?\"--of a mind that a question like this\r\nwould sound eminently professional in William\u0027s ears.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday, possibly; it all depends on Miss Annesley, sir. In Virginia\r\nnearly every night was ours. Here it\u0027s different.\" William hurriedly\r\npulled on his rubber boots and gloves, grabbed up the carriage sponges,\r\nand vanished.\r\n\r\nWarburton sat on the edge of his cot and laughed silently. All this was\r\nvery amusing. Had any man, since the beginning of time, found himself\r\nin a like position? He doubted it. And he was to be butler besides! It\r\nwould be something to remember in his old age. Yet, once or twice the\r\npins of his conscience pricked him. He _wasn\u0027t_ treating Nancy just\r\nright. He didn\u0027t want her to cry over his gracelessness; he didn\u0027t want\r\nher to think that he was heartless. But what could he do? He stood too\r\ndeeply committed.\r\n\r\nHe was puzzled about one thing, however, and, twist it as he would, he\r\ncould not solve it with any degree of satisfaction. Why, after what had\r\nhappened, had she hired him? If she could pass over that episode at the\r\ncarriage-door and forget it, _he_ couldn\u0027t. He knew that each time he\r\nsaw her the memory of that embrace and brotherly salute would rise\r\nbefore his eyes and rob him of some of his assurance--an attribute\r\nwhich was rather well developed in Mr. Robert, though he was loath to\r\nadmit it. If his actions were a mystery to her, hers were none the less\r\nso to him. He made up his mind to move guardedly in whatever he did, to\r\npractise control over his mobile features so as to avert any shock or\r\nthoughtless sign of interest. He knew that sooner or later the day\r\nwould come when he would be found out; but this made him not the less\r\neager to court that day.\r\n\r\nHe shaved himself, and was wiping his face on the towel when Celeste\r\nappeared in the doorway. She eyed him, her head inclined roguishly to\r\none side, the exact attitude of a bird that has suddenly met a curious\r\nand disturbing specimen of insect life.\r\n\r\n\"M\u0027sieu Zhames, Mees Annesley rides thees morning. You will pre_pairre_\r\nyourself according,\"--and she rattled on in her absurd native tongue\r\n(every other native tongue _is_ absurd to us, you know!)--\r\n\r\n    \"He is charming and handsome,\r\n    With his uniform and saber;\r\n    And his fine black eyes\r\n    Look love as he rides by!\"\r\n\r\nwhile the chef in the kitchen glared furiously at his omelette souffle,\r\nand vowed terrible things to M\u0027sieu Zhames if he looked at Celeste more\r\nthan twice a day.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning,\" said M\u0027sieu Zhames, hanging up his towel. His face\r\nglowed as the result of the vigorous rubbing it had received.\r\n\r\n_\"Bon jour!\"_--admiringly.\r\n\r\n\"Don\u0027t give me any of your _bong joors,_ Miss,\"--stolidly. \"There\u0027s\r\nonly one language for me, and that\u0027s English.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Merci!_ You Anglaises are _so_ conceit\u0027! How you like _me_ to teach\r\nyou French, eh, M\u0027sieu Zhames?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not for me,\"--shaking his head. She was very pretty, and under\r\nordinary circumstances . . . He did not finish the thought, but I will\r\nfor him. Under ordinary circumstances, M\u0027sieu Zhames would have kissed\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"No teach you French? _Non?_ Extra_orrd_inaire!\" She tripped away,\r\nlaughing, while the chef tugged at his royal and M\u0027sieu Zhames whistled.\r\n\r\n\"Hang the witch!\" the new groom murmured. \"Her mistress must be very\r\ngenerous, or very positive of her own charms, to keep a sprite like\r\nthis maid about her. I wonder if I\u0027ll run into Karloff?\" Karloff! The\r\nname chilled him, somehow. What was Karloff to her? Had he known that\r\nshe was to be in Washington for the winter? What irony, if fate should\r\nmake him the groom and Karloff the bridegroom! If Karloff loved her, he\r\ncould press his suit frankly and openly. And, as matters stood, what\r\nchance on earth had he, Warburton? \"Chuck was right; I\u0027ve made a\r\nmistake, and I am beginning to regret it the very first morning.\" He\r\nsnapped his fingers and proceeded to the right wing, where the horses\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nAt nine o\u0027clock he led Jane and Dick out to the porte-cochere and\r\nwaited. He had not long to loiter, for she came out at once, drawing on\r\nher gauntlets and taking in long breaths of the morning air. She nodded\r\nbriefly, but pleasantly, and came down the steps. Her riding-habit was\r\nof the conventional black, and her small, shapely boots were of\r\npatent-leather. She wore no hat on her glorious head, which showed her\r\ngood sense and her scorn for freckles and sunburn. But nature had given\r\nher one of those rare complexions upon which the sun and the wind have\r\nbut trifling effect.\r\n\r\n\"We shall ride north, James; the roads are better and freer. Jane has a\r\nhorror of cars.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Miss Annesley,\"--deferentially. \"You will have to teach me the\r\nlay of the land hereabouts, as I am rather green.\"\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027ll see to it that you are made perfectly familiar with the roads.\r\nYou do not know Washington very well, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Miss. Shall I give you a--er--boot up?\" He blushed. He had almost\r\nsaid \"leg up\".\r\n\r\nShe assented, and raised her boot, under which he placed his palm, and\r\nsprang into the saddle. He mounted in his turn and waited.\r\n\r\n\"When we ride alone, James, I shall not object to your riding at my\r\nside; but when I have guests, always remember to keep five yards to the\r\nrear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Miss.\" If he could have got rid of the idea of Karloff and the\r\npossibilities which his name suggested, all this would have appealed to\r\nhim as exceedingly funny.\r\n\r\n\"Forward, then!\"--and she touched Jane\u0027s flank with her crop.\r\n\r\nThe weather was perfect for riding: no sun, a keen breeze from the\r\nnorthwest, and a dust-settled road. Warburton confessed to me afterward\r\nthat this first ride with her was one of the most splendid he had ever\r\nridden. Both animals were perfect saddle-horses, such as are to be\r\nfound only in the South. They started up the road at a brisk trot, and\r\nlater broke into a canter which lasted fully a mile. How beautiful she\r\nwas, when at length they slowed down into a walk! Her cheeks were\r\nflaming, her eyes dancing and full of luster, her hair was tumbled\r\nabout and tendrils fluttered down her cheeks. She was Diana: only he\r\nhoped that she was not inclined to celibacy.\r\n\r\nWhat a mistake he had made! He could never get over this gulf which he\r\nhimself had thrust between them. This was no guise in which to meet a\r\nwoman of her high breeding. Under his breath he cursed the impulse that\r\nhad urged him to decline to attend the ball at the British embassy.\r\nThere he would have met her as his own true self, a soldier, a polished\r\ngentleman of the world, of learning and breeding. Nancy would have\r\nbrought them together, calls would have been exchanged, and he would\r\nhave defied Karloff. Then he chid himself for the feeling he had\r\nagainst the Russian. Karloff had a right to love this girl, a right\r\nwhich far eclipsed his own. Karloff was Karloff; a handsome fellow,\r\nwealthy, agreeable; while James was not James, neither was he wealthy\r\nnor at present agreeable. A man can not sigh very well on horseback,\r\nand the long breath which left Warburton\u0027s lips made a jerking, hissing\r\nsound.\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever ridden with women before. James?\"\r\n\r\n\"Several times with my major\u0027s daughter,\"--thoughtlessly.\r\n\r\n\"Your major\u0027s daughter? Who was your regimental colonel?\"\r\n\r\nJames bit his lips, and under his breath disregarded William\u0027s warning\r\nabout \"cussing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Permit me, Miss Annesley, to decline to answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ride as an attendant?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I was a trooper.\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak very good English for a stable-man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not always been a stable-man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say. I should give a good deal to know what you _have_ been.\r\nCome, James, tell me what the trouble was. I have influence; I might\r\nhelp you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am past help;\"--which was true enough, only the real significance of\r\nhis words passed over her head. \"I thank you for your kindness.\"\r\n\r\nIf she was piqued, she made no sign. \"James, were you once a gentleman,\r\nin the sense of being well-born?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Annesley, you would not believe me if I told you who I am and\r\nwhat I have been.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you a deserter?\"--looking him squarely in the eye. She saw the\r\ncolor as it crept under his tan.\r\n\r\n\"I have my honorable discharge,\"--briefly.\r\n\r\n\"I shall ask you to let me see it. Have you ever committed a\r\ndishonorable act? I have a right to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have committed one dishonorable act, Miss Annesley. I shall always\r\nregret it.\"\r\n\r\nShe gave him a penetrating glance. \"Very well; keep your secret.\"\r\n\r\nAnd there was no more questioning on that ride; there was not even\r\ncasual talk, such as a mistress might make to her servant. There was\r\nonly the clock-clock of hoofs and the chink of bit metal. Warburton did\r\nnot know whether he was glad or sorry.\r\n\r\nShe dismounted without her groom\u0027s assistance, which somewhat\r\ndisappointed that worthy gentleman. If she was angry, to his eye there\r\nwas no visible evidence of it. As he took the bridles in hand, she\r\naddressed him; though in doing so, she did not look at him, but gave\r\nher attention to her gauntlets, which she pulled slowly from her aching\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\n\"This afternoon I shall put you in the care of Pierre, the cook. I am\r\ngiving a small dinner on Monday evening, and I shall have to call on\r\nyou to serve the courses. Later I shall seek a butler, but for the\r\npresent you will have to act in that capacity.\"\r\n\r\nHe wasn\u0027t sure; it might have been a flash of sunlight from behind a\r\ncloud. If it was a smile, he would have given much to know what had\r\ncaused it.\r\n\r\nHe tramped off to the stables. A butler! Well, so be it. He could only\r\nreasonably object when she called upon him to act in the capacity of a\r\nchambermaid. He wondered why he had no desire to laugh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nA TICKLISH BUSINESS\r\n\r\n\r\nPierre was fierce and fat and forty, but he could cook the most\r\nwonderful roasts and ragouts that Warburton ever tasted; and he could\r\ntake a handful of vegetables and an insignificant bone and make a soup\r\nthat would have tickled the jaded palate of a Lucullus. Warburton\r\npresented himself at the kitchen door.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Pierre, striking a dramatic pose, a ladle in one hand and a\r\npan in the other. \"So you are zee new groom? Good! We make a butler out\r\nof you? Bah! Do you know zee difference between a broth and a soup? Eh?\"\r\n\r\nThe new groom gravely admitted that he did.\r\n\r\n\"Hear to me!\"--and Pierre struck his chest with a ladle. \"I teach you\r\nhow to sairve; _I_, Pierre Flageot, will teach a hostler to be a\r\nbutler! Bah!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what I am sent here for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear to me! If zay haf oysters, zay are placed on zee table before zee\r\nguests enter. _V\u0027la_? Then zee soup. You sairve one deesh at a time.\r\nYou do _not_ carry all zee deeshes at once. And you take zee deesh,\r\n_so_!\"--illustrating. \"Then you wait till zay push aside zee soup\r\ndeesh. Then you carry zem away. _V\u0027la_?\"\r\n\r\nWarburton signified that he understood.\r\n\r\n\"_I_ carve zee meats,\" went on the amiable Pierre. \"You haf nozzing to\r\ndo wiz zee meats. You rest zee deesh on zee flat uf zee hand, _so_!\r\nAlways sairve to zee _right_ uf zee guest. Vatch zat i zay do not move\r\nvhile you sairve. You spill zee soup, and I keel you! To spill zee soup\r\nees a crime. Now, take hold uf thees soup deesh.\"\r\n\r\nWarburton took it clumsily by the rim. Pierre snatched it away with a\r\nvolley of French oaths. William said that there was to be no \"cussing,\"\r\nbut Pierre seemed to be an immune and not included in this order.\r\n\r\n\"Idiot! Imbecile! _Non, non! Thees_ way. You would put zee thumb in zee\r\nsoup. Zare! You haf catch zat. Come to zee dining-hall. I show you. I\r\nexplain.\"\r\n\r\nThe new groom was compelled to put forth all his energies to keep his\r\nface straight. If he laughed, he was lost. If only his old mates could\r\nsee him now! The fop of Troop A playing at butler! Certainly he would\r\nhave to write Chuck about it--(which he most certainly never did).\r\nStill, the ordeal in the dining-room was a severe one. Nothing he\r\nattempted was done satisfactorily; Pierre, having in mind Celeste\u0027s\r\nfrivolity and this man\u0027s good looks, made the task doubly hard. He\r\nhissed \"Idiot!\" and \"Imbecile!\" and \"Jackass!\" as many times as there\r\nare knives and forks and spoons at a course dinner. It was when they\r\ncame to the wines that Pierre became mollified. He was forced to\r\nacknowledge that the new groom needed no instructions as to the varying\r\ntemperatures of clarets and burgundies. Warburton longed to get out\r\ninto the open and yell. It was very funny. He managed, however, on\r\nthird rehearsal, to acquit himself with some credit. They returned to\r\nthe kitchen again, where they found Celeste nibbling crackers and\r\ncheese. She smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" The vowel was given a prolonged roll. \"So, Mademoiselle, you haf\r\nto come and look on, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there any objection, Monsieur?\" retorted Celeste in her native\r\ntongue, making handsome eyes at Warburton, who was greatly amused.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! if he was hideous, would you be putting on those ribbons I gave\r\nyou to wear on Sundays?\" snarled Pierre.\r\n\r\nWarburton followed their French without any difficulty. It was the\r\nFrench of the Parisian, with which he was fairly conversant. But his\r\nface remained impassive and his brows only mildly curious.\r\n\r\n\"I shall throw them away, Monsieur Flageot, if you dare to talk to me\r\nlike that. He _is_ handsome, and you are jealous, and I am glad. You\r\nbehaved horribly to that coarse Nanon last Sunday. Because she scrubs\r\nthe steps of the French embassy you consider her above me, _me!_\"\r\n\r\n\"You are crazy!\" roared Pierre. \"You introduced me to her so that you\r\nmight make eyes at that abominable valet of the secretary!\"\r\n\r\nCeleste flounced (whatever means of locomotion that is) abruptly from\r\nthe kitchen. Pierre turned savagely to his protege.\r\n\r\n\"Go! And eef you look at her, idiot, I haf revenge myself. Oh, I am\r\ncalm! Bah! Go to zee stables, cattle!\" And he rattled his pans at a\r\ngreat rate.\r\n\r\nWarburton was glad enough to escape.\r\n\r\n\"I have brought discord into the land, it would seem.\"\r\n\r\nBut his trials were not over. The worst ordeal was yet to come. At\r\nfive, orders were given to harness the coach-horses to the coupe and\r\nhave them at the steps promptly at eight-thirty. Miss Annesley had\r\nsignified her intention of making a call in the city. Warburton had not\r\nthe slightest suspicion of the destination. He didn\u0027t care where it\r\nwas. It would be dark and he would pass unrecognized. He gave the order\r\nno more thought. Promptly at eight-thirty he drove up to the steps. A\r\nmoment later she issued forth, accompanied by a gentleman in evening\r\ndress. It was too dark for Warburton to distinguish his features.\r\n\r\n\"I am very sorry, Count, to leave you; but you understand perfectly. It\r\nis an old school friend of mine whom I haven\u0027t seen in a long time; one\r\nof the best girl friends I have ever known. I promised to dine with her\r\nto-night, but I broke that promise and agreed to spend the evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not disturb yourself on my account,\" replied the man in broken\r\nEnglish, which was rather pleasant to the ear. \"Your excellent father\r\nand I can pass the evening very well.\"\r\n\r\nKarloff! Warburton\u0027s chin sank into his collar and his hands trembled.\r\nThis man Karloff had very penetrating eyes, even in the dark.\r\n\r\n\"But I shall miss the music which I promised myself. Ah, if you only\r\nknew how adorable you are when you play the violin! I become lost, I\r\nforget the world and its sordidness. I forget everything but that\r\nmysterious voice which you alone know how to arouse from that little\r\nbox of wood. You are a great artist, and if you were before the public,\r\nthe world would go mad over you--as I have!\"\r\n\r\nSo she played the violin, thought the unhappy man on the box of the\r\ncoupe.\r\n\r\n\"Count, you know that is taboo; you must not talk to me like\r\nthat,\"--with a nervous glance at the groom.\r\n\r\n\"The groom embarrasses you?\" The count laughed. \"Well, it is only a\r\ngroom, an animal which does not understand these things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides, I do not play nearly so well as you would have me\r\nbelieve,\"--steering him to safer channels.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever you undertake, Mademoiselle, becomes at once an\r\nart,\"--gallantly. \"Good night!\"--and the count saluted her hand as he\r\nhelped her into the coupe.\r\n\r\nHow M\u0027sieu Zhames would have liked to jump down and pommel Monsieur le\r\nComte! Several wicked thoughts surged through our jehu\u0027s brain, but to\r\nexecute any one of them in her presence was impossible.\r\n\r\n\"Good night, Count. I shall see you at dinner on Monday.\"\r\n\r\nShe would, eh? And her new butler would be on duty that same evening?\r\nWithout a doubt. M\u0027sieu Zhames vowed under his breath that if he got a\r\ngood chance he would make the count look ridiculous. Not even a king\r\ncan retain his dignity while a stream of hot soup is trickling down his\r\nspinal column. Warburton smiled. He was mentally acting like a\r\nschool-boy disappointed in love. His own keen sense of the humorous\r\ncame to his rescue.\r\n\r\n\"James, to the city, No.--Scott Circle, and hurry.\" The door closed.\r\n\r\nScott Circle? Warburton\u0027s spine wrinkled. Heaven help him, he was\r\ndriving Miss Annesley to his own brother\u0027s house! What the devil was\r\ngetting into fate, anyhow? He swore softly all the way to the\r\nConnecticut Avenue extension. He made three mistakes before he struck\r\nSixteenth Street. Reaching Scott Circle finally, he had no difficulty\r\nin recognizing the house. He drew up at the stepping-stone, alighted\r\nand opened the door.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be gone perhaps an hour and a half, James. You may drive\r\naround, but return sharply at ten-thirty.\" Betty ran up the steps and\r\nrang the bell.\r\n\r\nOur jehu did _not_ wait to see the door open, but drove away,\r\nlickety-clip. I do not know what a mile lickety-clip is generally made\r\nin, but I am rather certain that the civil law demands twenty-five\r\ndollars for the same. The gods were with him this time, and no one\r\ncalled him to a halt. When he had gone as far away from Scott Circle as\r\nhe dared go, his eye was attracted by a genial cigar sign. He hailed a\r\nboy to hold the horses and went inside. He bought a dozen cigars and\r\nlit one. He didn\u0027t even take the trouble to see if he could get the\r\ncigars for nothing, there being a penny-in-the-slot machine in one\r\ncorner of the shop. I am sure that if he had noticed it, it would have\r\nenticed him, for the spirit of chance was well-grounded in him, as it\r\nis in all Army men. But he hurried out, threw the boy a dime, and drove\r\naway. For an hour and twenty minutes he drove and smoked and pondered.\r\nSo she played the violin! played it wonderfully, as the count had\r\ndeclared. He was passionately fond of music. In London, in Paris, in\r\nBerlin, in Vienna, he had been an untiring, unfailing patron of the\r\nopera. Some night he resolved to listen at the window, providing the\r\nwindow was open. Yes, a hundred times Chuck was right. Any other girl,\r\nand this jest might have passed capitally; but he wanted the respect of\r\nthis particular woman, and he had carelessly closed the doors to her\r\nregard. She might tolerate him, that would be all. She would look upon\r\nhim as a hobbledehoy.\r\n\r\nHe approached the curb again in front of the house, and gazed wistfully\r\nat the lighted windows. Here was another great opportunity gone. How he\r\nlonged to dash into the house, confess, and have done with it!\r\n\r\n\"I wish Chuck was in there. I wish he would come out and kick me good\r\nand hearty.\"\r\n\r\n(Chuck would have been delighted to perform the trifling service; and\r\nhe would not have gone about it with any timidity, either.)\r\n\r\n\"Hang the horses! I\u0027m going to take a peek in at the side window,\"--and\r\nhe slid cautiously from the box. He stole around the side and stopped\r\nat one of the windows. The curtain was not wholly lowered, and he could\r\nsee into the drawing-room. There they were, all of them; and Miss\r\nAnnesley was holding the baby, which Mrs. Jack had awakened and brought\r\ndown stairs. He could see by the diffident manner in which Jack was\r\ncurling the ends of his mustache that they were comparing the baby with\r\nhim. \"The conceited ass!\" muttered the self-appointed outcast; \"it\r\ndoesn\u0027t look any more like him than it does like me!\" Here Miss\r\nAnnesley kissed the baby, and Warburton hoped that they hadn\u0027t washed\r\nits face since he performed the same act.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jack disappeared with the hope of the family, and Nancy got out a\r\nbundle of photographs. M\u0027sieu Zhames would have given almost anything\r\nhe possessed to know what these photographs represented. Crane his neck\r\nas he would, he could see nothing. All he could do was to watch.\r\nSometimes they laughed, sometimes they became grave; sometimes they\r\nexplained, and their guest grew very attentive Once she even leaned\r\nforward eagerly. It was about this time that our jehu chanced to look\r\nat the clock on the mantel, and immediately concluded to vacate the\r\npremises. It was half after ten. He returned to his box forthwith. (I\r\nwas going to use the word \"alacrity,\" but I find that it means\r\n\"cheerful readiness.\") After what seemed to him an interminable wait,\r\nthe front door opened and a flood of light blinded him. He heard\r\nNancy\u0027s voice.\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027m so sorry, Betty, that I can\u0027t dine with you on Monday. We are\r\ngoing to Arlington. So sorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027m not!\" murmured the wretch on the box. \"I\u0027m devilish glad! Imagine\r\npassing soup to one\u0027s sister! By George, it was a narrow one! It would\r\nhave been all over then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there will be plenty of times this winter,\" said Betty. \"I shall\r\nsee you all at the Country Club Sunday afternoon. Good night, every\r\none. No, no; there\u0027s no need of any of you coming to the carriage.\"\r\n\r\nBut brother Jack _did_ walk to the door with her; however, he gave not\r\nthe slightest attention to the groom, for which _he_ was grateful.\r\n\r\n\"You must all come and spend the evening with me soon,\" said Betty,\r\nentering the carriage.\r\n\r\n\"That we shall,\" said brother Jack, closing the door for her. \"Good\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Home, James,\" said the voice within the carriage.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether or not he slept soundly that night on his stable\r\ncot. He never would confess. But it is my private opinion that he\r\ndidn\u0027t sleep at all, but spent a good part of the night out of doors,\r\nsmoking very black, strong cigars.\r\n\r\nCeleste, however, could have told you that her mistress, as she\r\nretired, was in a most amiable frame of mind. Once she laughed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nA RUNAWAY\r\n\r\n\r\nFour days passed. I might have used the word \"sped,\" only that verb\r\ncould not be truthfully applied. Never before in the history of time\r\n(so our jehu thought) did four days cast their shadows more slowly\r\nacross the dial of the hours. From noon till night there was a madding\r\nnothing to do but polish bits and buckles and stirrups and ornamental\r\nsilver. He would have been totally miserable but for the morning rides.\r\nThese were worth while; for he was riding Pirate, and there was always\r\nthat expectation of the unexpected. But Pirate behaved himself\r\npuzzlingly well. Fortunately for the jehu, these rides were always into\r\nthe north country. He was continually possessed with fear lest she\r\nwould make him drive through the shopping district. If he met Nancy, it\r\nwould be, in the parlance of the day, all off. Nancy would have\r\nrecognized him in a beard like a Cossack\u0027s; and here he was with the\r\nboy\u0027s face--the face she never would forget.\r\n\r\nHe was desperately in love. I do not know what desperately in love is,\r\nmy own love\u0027s course running smoothly enough; but I can testify that it\r\nwas making Mr. Robert thin and appetiteless. Every morning the impulse\r\ncame to him to tell her all; but every morning his courage oozed like\r\nBob Acres\u0027, and his lips became dumb. I dare say that if she had\r\nquestioned him he would have told her all; but for some reason she had\r\nceased to inquire into his past. Possibly her young mind was occupied\r\nwith pleasanter things.\r\n\r\nHe became an accomplished butler, and served so well in rehearsals that\r\nPierre could only grumble. One afternoon she superintended the comedy.\r\nShe found a thousand faults with him, so many, in fact, that Pierre did\r\nnot understand what it meant, and became possessed with the vague idea\r\nthat she was hitting him over the groom\u0027s shoulder. He did not like it;\r\nand later, when they were alone, Warburton was distinctly impressed\r\nwith Pierre\u0027s displeasure.\r\n\r\n\"You can not please _her_, and you can not please _me_. Bah! Zat ees\r\nvat comes uf teaching a groom table manners instead uf stable manners.\r\nAnd you vill smell uf horse! I do _not_ understand Mees Annesley; no!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"May I go now, Miss?\"--ACT II]\r\n\r\nAnd there were other humiliations, petty ones. She chid him on having\r\nthe stirrup too long or too short; the curb chain was rusting; this\r\npiece of ornamental silver did not shine like that one; Jane\u0027s fetlocks\r\nwere too long; Pirate\u0027s hoofs weren\u0027t thoroughly oiled. With dogged\r\npatience he tried to remedy all these faults. It was only when they had\r\nhad a romping run down the road that this spirit fell away from her,\r\nand she talked pleasantly.\r\n\r\nTwice he ran into Karloff; but that shrewd student of human nature did\r\nnot consider my hero worth studying; a grave mistake on his part, as he\r\nwas presently to learn. He was a handsome man, and the only thing he\r\nnoticed about the groom was his handsome face. He considered it a crime\r\nfor a servant to be endowed with personal attractions. A servant in the\r\neyes of a Russian noble excites less interest than a breedless dog. Mr.\r\nRobert made no complaint; he was very well satisfied to have the count\r\nignore him entirely. Once he met the count in the Turkish room, where,\r\nin the capacity of butler, he served liqueur and cigars. There was a\r\ncertain grim humor in lighting his rival\u0027s cigar for him. This service\r\nwas a test of his ability to pass through a room without knocking over\r\ntaborets and chairs. Another time they met, when Betty and the two of\r\nthem took a long ride. Karloff _did_ notice how well the groom rode his\r\nmettlesome mount, being himself a soldier and a daring horseman.\r\nWarburton had some trouble. Pirate did not take to the idea of\r\nbreathing Jane and Dick\u0027s dust; he wanted to lead these second-raters.\r\nMr. James\u0027 arms ached that afternoon from the effort he had put forth\r\nto restrain Pirate and keep him in his proper place, five yards to the\r\nrear.\r\n\r\nNothing happened Sunday; the day went by uneventfully. He escaped the\r\nordeal of driving her to the Chevy Chase Club, William being up that\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nThen Monday came, and with it Betty\u0027s curious determination to ride\r\nPirate.\r\n\r\n\"You wish to ride Pirate, Miss?\" exclaimed James, his horror of the\r\nidea openly manifest.\r\n\r\n\"Saddle him for me,\"--peremptorily. \"I desire to ride him. I find Jane\r\nisn\u0027t exciting enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, Miss Annesley,\" he said, \"but I had rather you would not\r\nmake the attempt.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had rather I would not make the attempt?\"--slowly repeating the\r\nwords, making a knife of each one of them, tipped with the poison of\r\nher contempt. \"I do not believe I quite understand you.\"\r\n\r\nHe bravely met the angry flash of her eyes. There were times when the\r\ncolor of these eyes did not resemble sapphires; rather disks of\r\ngun-metal, caused by a sudden dilation of the pupils.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Miss, I had rather you would not.\"\r\n\r\n\"James, you forget yourself. Saddle Pirate, and take Jane back to the\r\nstables. Besides, Jane has a bit of a cold.\" She slapped her boot with\r\nher riding-crop and indolently studied the scurrying clouds overhead;\r\nfor the day was windy.\r\n\r\nSoberly Warburton obeyed. He was hurt and angry, and he knew not what\r\nbesides. Heavens, if anything should happen to her! His hopes rose a\r\nbit. Pirate had shown no temper so far that morning. He docilely\r\npermitted his master to put on the side-saddle. But as he came out into\r\nthe air again, he threw forward his ears, stretched out his long black\r\nneck, took in a great breath, and whinnied a hoarse challenge to the\r\nelements. William had already saddled Dick, who looked askance at his\r\nblack rival\u0027s small compact heels.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid of him,\" said Warburton, as he returned. \"He will run away\r\nwith you. I did not wholly subjugate him the other day. He pulls till\r\nmy arms ache.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Annesley shrugged and patted Pirate on the nose and offered him a\r\nlump of sugar. The thirst for freedom and a wild run down the wind\r\nlurked in Pirate\u0027s far-off gazing eyes, and he ignored the sign of\r\nconciliation which his mistress made him.\r\n\r\n\"I am not afraid of him. Besides, Dick can outrun and out jump him.\"\r\n\r\nThis did not reassure Warburton, nor did he know what this comparison\r\nmeant, being an ordinary mortal.\r\n\r\n\"With all respect to you, Miss Annesley, I am sorry that you are\r\ndetermined to ride him. He is most emphatically not a lady\u0027s horse, and\r\nyou have never ridden him. Your skirts will irritate him, and if he\r\nsees your crop, he\u0027ll bolt.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not reply, but merely signified her desire to mount. No sooner\r\nwas she up, however, than she secretly regretted her caprice; but not\r\nfor a hundred worlds would she have permitted this groom to know. But\r\nPirate, with that rare instinct of the horse, knew that his mistress\r\nwas not sure of him. He showed the whites of his eyes and began pawing\r\nthe gravel. The girl glanced covertly at her groom and found no color\r\nin his cheeks. Two small muscular lumps appeared at the corners of her\r\njaws. She would ride Pirate, and nothing should stop her; nothing,\r\nnothing. Womanlike, knowing herself to be in the wrong, she was furious.\r\n\r\nAnd Pirate surprised them both. During the first mile he behaved\r\nhimself in the most gentlemanly fashion; and if he shied once or twice,\r\nwaltzed a little, it was only because he was full of life and spirit.\r\nThey trotted, they cantered, ran and walked. Warburton, hitherto\r\nholding himself in readiness for whatever might happen, relaxed the\r\ntension of his muscles, and his shoulders sank relievedly. Perhaps,\r\nafter all, his alarm had been needless. The trouble with Pirate might\r\nbe the infrequency with which he had been saddled and ridden. But he\r\nknew that the girl would not soon forget his interference. There would\r\nbe more humiliations, more bitter pills for him to swallow. It pleased\r\nhim, however, to note the ease with which Dick kept pace with Pirate.\r\n\r\nAs for the most beautiful person in all the great world, I am afraid\r\nthat she was beginning to feel self-important. Now that her confidence\r\nwas fully restored, she never once spoke to, or looked at, her groom.\r\nOccasionally from the corner of her eye she could see the white patch\r\non Dick\u0027s nose.\r\n\r\n\"James,\" she said maliciously and suddenly, \"go back five yards. I wish\r\nto ride alone.\"\r\n\r\nWarburton, his face burning, fell back. And thus she made her first\r\nmistake. The second and final mistake came immediately after. She\r\ntouched Pirate with her heel, and he broke from a trot into a lively\r\ngallop. Dick, without a touch of the boot, kept his distance to a foot.\r\nPirate, no longer seeing Dick at his side, concluded that he had left\r\nhis rival behind; and the suppressed mischief in his black head began\r\nto find an outlet. Steadily he arched his neck; steadily but surely he\r\ndrew down on the reins. The girl felt the effort and tried to frustrate\r\nit. In backing her pull with her right hand, the end of her crop\r\nflashed down the side of Pirate\u0027s head--the finishing touch. There was\r\na wild leap, a blur of dust, and Mr. Pirate, well named after his\r\nfreebooting sires, his head down where he wanted it, his feet rolling\r\nlike a snare-drum, Mr. Pirate ran away, headed for heaven only knew\r\nwhere.\r\n\r\nFor a brief moment Warburton lost his nerve; he was struck with horror.\r\nIf she could not hold her seat, she would be killed or dreadfully hurt,\r\nand perhaps disfigured. It seemed rather strange, as he recalled it,\r\nthat Dick, instead of himself, should have taken the initiative. The\r\nnoble sorrel, formerly a cavalry horse, shot forward magnificently.\r\nDoubtless his horse-sense took in the situation, or else he did not\r\nlike the thought of yonder proud, supercilious show-horse beating him\r\nin a running race. So, a very fast mile was put to the rear.\r\n\r\nThe girl, appreciating her peril, did as all good horsewomen would have\r\ndone: locked her knee on the horn and held on. The rush of wind tore\r\nthe pins from her hair which, like a golden plume, stretched out behind\r\nher. (Have you ever read anything like this before? I dare say. But to\r\nWarburton and the girl, it never occurred that other persons had gone\r\nthrough like episodes. It was real, and actual, and single, and tragic\r\nto them.)\r\n\r\nThe distance between the two horses began slowly to lessen, and\r\nWarburton understood, in a nebulous way, what the girl had meant when\r\nshe said that Dick could outrun Pirate. If Pirate kept to the road,\r\nDick would bring him down; but if Pirate took it into his head to vault\r\na fence! Warburton shuddered. Faster, faster, over this roll of earth,\r\nclattering across this bridge, around this curve and that angle. Once\r\nthe sight of a team drawing a huge grain-wagon sent a shiver to\r\nWarburton\u0027s heart. But they thundered past with a foot to spare. The\r\nold negro on the seat stared after them, his ebony face drawn with\r\nwonder and the whites of his eyes showing.\r\n\r\nFoot by foot, yard by yard, the space lessened, till Dick\u0027s nose was\r\nwithin three feet of Pirate\u0027s flowing tail. Warburton fairly lifted\r\nDick along with his knees. I only wish I could describe the race as my\r\njehu told it to me. The description held me by the throat. I could see\r\nthe flashing by of trees and houses and fields; the scampering of\r\npiccaninnies across the road; the horses from the meadows dashing up to\r\nthe fences and whinnying; the fine stone and dust which Pirate\u0027s\r\nrattling heels threw into my jehu\u0027s face and eyes; the old pain\r\nthrobbing anew in his leg. And when he finally drew alongside the black\r\nbrute and saw the white, set face of the girl he loved, I can imagine\r\nno greater moment but one in his life. There was no fear on her face,\r\nbut there was appeal in her eyes as she half turned her head. He leaned\r\nacross the intervening space and slid his arm around her waist. The two\r\nhorses came together and twisted his leg cruelly. His jaws snapped.\r\n\r\n\"Let the stirrup go!\" he cried. \"Let go, quick!\" She heard him. \"Your\r\nknee from the horn! I can\u0027t keep them together any longer. Now!\"\r\n\r\nBrave and plucky and cool she was. She obeyed him instantly. There was\r\na mighty heave, a terrible straining of the back and the knees, and\r\nPirate was freed of his precious burden. The hardest part of it came\r\nnow. Dick could not be made to slow down abruptly. He wanted to keep\r\nright on after his rival. So, between holding the girl with his right\r\narm and pulling the horse with his left, Warburton saw that he could\r\nkeep up this terrible effort but a very short time. Her arms were\r\nconvulsively wound around his neck, and this added to the strain. Not a\r\nword did she say; her eyes were closed, as if she expected any moment\r\nto be dashed to the earth.\r\n\r\nBut Dick was only a mortal horse. The fierce run and the double burden\r\nbegan to tell, and shortly his head came up. Warburton stopped him. The\r\ngirl slid to the ground, and in a moment he was at her side. And just\r\nin time. The reaction was too much for her. Dazedly she brushed her\r\nhair from her eyes, stared wildly at Warburton, and fainted. He did not\r\ncatch her with that graceful precision which on the stage is so\r\nfamiliar to us. No. He was lucky to snatch one of her arms, thus\r\npreventing her head from striking the road. He dragged her to the side\r\nof the highway and rested her head on his shaking knees. Things grew\r\ndark for a time. To tell the truth, he himself was very close to that\r\nfeminine weakness which the old fellows, in their rough and ready\r\nplays, used to call \"vapours\". But he forced his heart to steady itself.\r\n\r\nAnd what do you suppose the rascal did--with nobody but Dick to watch\r\nhim? Why, he did what any healthy young man in love would have done:\r\npressed his lips to the girl\u0027s hair, his eyes filling and half a sob in\r\nhis parched throat. He dolefully pictured himself a modern Antiochus,\r\ndying of love and never confessing it. Then he kissed her hair again;\r\nonly her hair, for somehow he felt that her lips and cheeks were as yet\r\ninviolable to his touch. I should have liked to see the picture they\r\nmade: the panting horse a dozen rods away, looking at them inquiringly;\r\nthe girl in her dust-covered habit, her hair spreading out like seaweed\r\non a wave, her white face, her figure showing its graceful lines; my\r\njehu, his hair matted to his brow, the streaks of dust and perspiration\r\non his face, the fear and love and longing in his dark eyes. I\r\nrecollect a picture called _Love and Honor,_ or something like that. It\r\nnever appealed to me. It lacked action. It simply represented a fellow\r\nurging a girl to elope with him. Both of them were immaculately\r\ndressed. But here, on this old highway leading into Maryland, was\r\nsomething real. A battle had been fought and won.\r\n\r\nFainting is but transitory; by and by she opened her eyes, and stared\r\nvaguely into the face above her. I do not know what she saw there;\r\nwhatever it was it caused her to struggle to her feet. There was color\r\nenough in her cheeks now; and there was a question, too, in her eyes.\r\nOf Warburton it asked, \"What did you do when I lay there unconscious?\"\r\nI\u0027m afraid there was color in his face, too. Her gaze immediately roved\r\nup the road. There was no Pirate, only a haze of dust. Doubtless he was\r\nstill going it, delighted over the trouble he had managed to bring\r\nabout. Warburton knelt at the girl\u0027s side and brushed the dust from her\r\nskirt. She eyed him curiously. I shan\u0027t say that she smiled; I don\u0027t\r\nknow, for I wasn\u0027t there.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile she made several futile attempts to put up her hair, and as a\r\nfinality she braided it and let it hang down her back. Suddenly and\r\nunaccountably she grew angry--angry at herself, at James, at the\r\nrascally horse that had brought her to this pass. Warburton saw\r\nsomething of this emotion in her eyes, and to avoid the storm he walked\r\nover to Dick, picked up the reins, and led him back.\r\n\r\n\"If you will mount Dick, Miss,\" he said, \"I will lead him home. It\u0027s\r\nabout five miles, I should say.\"\r\n\r\nThe futility and absurdity of her anger aroused her sense of the\r\nridiculous; and a smile, warm and merry, flashed over her stained face.\r\nIt surprised her groom.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, James. You were right. I ought not to have ridden Pirate. I\r\nam punished for my conceit. Five miles? It will be a long walk.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shan\u0027t mind it in the least,\" replied James, inordinately happy; and\r\nhe helped her to the saddle and adjusted the left stirrup.\r\n\r\nSo the journey home began. Strangely enough, neither seemed to care\r\nparticularly what had or might become of Pirate. He disappeared,\r\nmentally and physically. One thing dampened the journey for Warburton.\r\nHis \"game leg\" ached cruelly, and after the second mile (which was\r\ntraversed without speech from either of them), he fell into a slight\r\nlimp. From her seat above and behind him, she saw this limp.\r\n\r\n\"You have hurt yourself?\" she asked gently.\r\n\r\n\"Not to-day, Miss,\"--briefly.\r\n\r\n\"When he ran away with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. It\u0027s an old trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"While you were a soldier?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\nHe turned in surprise. All these questions were rather unusual.\r\nNevertheless he answered her, and truthfully.\r\n\r\n\"I was shot in the leg by a drunken Indian.\"\r\n\r\n\"While on duty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\" Unconsciously he was forgetting to add \"Miss\", which was the\r\npatent of his servility. And I do not think that just then she noticed\r\nthis subtraction from the respect due her.\r\n\r\nIt was eleven o\u0027clock when they arrived at the gates. She dismounted\r\nalone. Warburton was visibly done up.\r\n\r\n\"Any orders for this afternoon, Miss?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall want the victoria at three. I have some shopping to do and a\r\ncall to make. Send William after Pirate. I am very grateful for what\r\nyou have done.\"\r\n\r\nHe made no reply, for he saw her father coming down the steps.\r\n\r\n\"Betty,\" said the colonel, pale and worried, \"have you been riding\r\nPirate? Where is he, and what in the world has happened?\"--noting the\r\ndust on her habit and her tangled hair.\r\n\r\nShe explained: she told the story rather coolly, Warburton thought, but\r\nshe left out no detail.\r\n\r\n\"You have James to thank for my safety, father. He was very calm and\r\nclear-headed.\"\r\n\r\n_Calm and clear-headed!_ thought Warburton.\r\n\r\nThe girl then entered the house, humming. Most women would have got out\r\nthe lavender salts and lain down the rest of the day, considering the\r\nroutine of a fashionable dinner, which was the chief duty of the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n\"I am grateful to you, James. My daughter is directly in your care when\r\nshe rides, and I give you full authority. Never permit her to mount any\r\nhorse but her own. She is all I have; and if anything should happen to\r\nher--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; I understand.\"\r\n\r\nThe colonel followed his daughter; and Warburton led Dick to the\r\nstables, gave his orders to William, and flung himself down on his cot.\r\nHe was dead tired. And the hour he had dreaded was come! He was to\r\ndrive her through the shopping district. Well, so be it. If any one\r\nexposed him, very good. This groom business was decidedly like work.\r\nAnd there was that confounded dinner-party, and he would have to limp\r\naround a table and carry soup plates! And as likely as not he would run\r\ninto the very last person he expected to see.\r\n\r\nWhich he did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nAN ORDEAL OR TWO\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Robert vows that he will never forgive me for the ten minutes\u0027\r\nagony which I gratuitously added to his measure. It came about in this\r\nwise. I was on my way down Seventeenth Street that afternoon, and it\r\nwas in front of a fashionable apartment house that I met him. He was\r\nseated on his box, the whip at the proper angle, and his eyes riveted\r\non his pair\u0027s ears. It was the first time I had seen him since the day\r\nof the episode at the police-station. He was growing thin. He did not\r\nsee me, and he did not even notice me till I stopped and the sound of\r\nmy heels on the walk ceased. Arms akimbo, I surveyed him.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" I began. I admit that the smile I offered him was a deal like\r\nthat which a cat offers a cornered mouse.\r\n\r\nHe turned his head. I shall not repeat the word he muttered. It was\r\nvery improper, though they often refer to it in the Sabbath-schools,\r\nalways in a hushed breath, however, as though to full-voice it would\r\nonly fan the flames still higher.\r\n\r\n\"What have you to say for yourself?\" I went on.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing for myself, but for you, move on and let me alone, or when I\r\nget the opportunity, Chuck, I\u0027ll punch your head, glasses or no\r\nglasses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brother-in-law or no brother-in-law.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chuck, will you go on?\"--hoarsely. \"I mean it.\"\r\n\r\nI saw that he did. \"You don\u0027t look very happy for a man who has cracked\r\nso tremendous a joke.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you go along?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not till I get good and ready, James. I\u0027ve told too many lies on your\r\naccount already not to make myself a present of this joyful reunion.\r\nHas Miss Annesley any idea of the imposture?\"\r\n\r\nHe did not answer.\r\n\r\n\"How did you like waiting in Scott Circle the other night?\"\r\n\r\nStill no answer. I have half an idea that he was making ready to leap\r\nfrom his box. He ran his fingers up and down the lines. I could see\r\nthat he was mad through and through; but I enjoyed the scene\r\nnevertheless. He deserved a little roasting on the gridiron.\r\n\r\n\"I am given to understand,\" I continued, \"that you act as butler,\r\nbesides, and pass the soup around the table.\"\r\n\r\nSilence. Then I heard a door close, and saw a look of despair grow on\r\nhis face. I turned and saw Miss Annesley and Mrs. Chadwick coming down\r\nthe steps.\r\n\r\n\"Why, how do you do, Mr. Henderson? Mrs. Chadwick.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have already had the pleasure of meeting this famous young orator,\"\r\npurred Mrs. Chadwick, giving me her hand. She was a fashionable, not to\r\nsay brilliant, _intrigante_. I knew her to have been concerned\r\nindirectly with half a dozen big lobby schemes. She was rather wealthy.\r\nBut she was seen everywhere, and everywhere was admired. She was as\r\ncompletely at home abroad as here in Washington. She was a widow,\r\nperhaps thirty-eight, handsome and fascinating, a delightful\r\n_raconteur_, and had the remarkable reputation of never indulging in\r\nscandal. She was the repository of more secrets than I should care to\r\ndiscover.\r\n\r\nI recall one night at a state function when she sat between the French\r\nambassador and that wily Chinaman, Li Hung Chang. She discoursed on\r\nwines in French with the ambassador and immediately turned to the\r\nChinaman and recited Confucius in the original Chinese. Where she had\r\never found time to study Chinese is a mystery to every one. The\r\nincident made her quite famous that winter. Brains are always tolerated\r\nin Washington, and if properly directed, push a person a good deal\r\nfurther than wealth or pedigree. Washington forgives everything but\r\nstupidity.\r\n\r\nNot until recently did I learn that at one time Karloff had been very\r\nattentive to her. His great knowledge of American politics doubtless\r\ncame to him through her.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you bound?\" asked Miss Annesley.\r\n\r\n\"I am on the way to the War Department.\"\r\n\r\n\"Plenty of room; jump in and we shall drop you there. James, drive to\r\nthe War Department.\"\r\n\r\nOrdinarily I should have declined, as I generally prefer to walk; but\r\nin this instance it would be superfluous to say that I was delighted to\r\naccept the invitation. I secretly hugged myself as I thought of the\r\ndriver.\r\n\r\n\"How is Miss Warburton?\" asked Miss Annesley, as she settled back among\r\nthe cushions.\r\n\r\n\"Beautiful as ever,\" I replied, smiling happily,\r\n\r\n\"You must meet Miss Warburton, Grace,\"--speaking to Mrs. Chadwick, who\r\nlooked at me with polite inquiry. \"One of the most charming girls in\r\nthe land, and as good as she is beautiful. Mr. Henderson is the most\r\nfortunate of young men.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I admit. She was greatly disappointed that you did not meet her\r\nyounger brother.\" First shot at the groom.\r\n\r\n\"I did expect to meet him, but I understand that he has gone on a\r\nhunting expedition. Whom does he resemble?\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither Nancy nor Jack,\" I said. \"He\u0027s a good-looking beggar, though,\r\nonly you can\u0027t depend upon him for five minutes at a time. Hadn\u0027t seen\r\nthe family in more than two years. Spends one night at home, and is off\r\nagain, no one knows where. Some persons like him, but I like a man with\r\nmore stability. Not but what he has his good points; but he is a born\r\nvagabond. His brother expects to get him a berth at Vienna and is\r\nworking rather successfully toward that end.\" I wondered how this bit\r\nof news affected the groom.\r\n\r\n\"A diplomat?\" said Mrs. Chadwick. \"That is the life for a young man\r\nwith brains. Is he a good linguist?\"\r\n\r\n\"Capital! Speaks French, German, and Spanish, besides I don\u0027t know how\r\nmany Indian sign-languages.\" Now I was patting the groom on the back. I\r\nsat facing the ladies, so it was impossible to see the expression on\r\nhis face. I kept up this banter till we arrived at the Department. I\r\nbade the ladies good day. I do not recollect when I enjoyed ten minutes\r\nmore thoroughly.\r\n\r\nAn hour in the shopping district, that is to say, up and down\r\nPennsylvania Avenue, where everybody who was anybody was similarly\r\noccupied, shopping, nearly took the spine out of our jehu. Everywhere\r\nhe imagined he saw Nancy. And half a dozen times he saw persons whom he\r\nknew, persons he had dined with in New York, persons he had met abroad.\r\nBut true to human nature, they were looking toward higher things than a\r\ngroom in livery. When there was no more room for bundles, the women\r\nstarted for Mrs. Chadwick\u0027s apartments.\r\n\r\nSaid Mrs. Chadwick in French: \"Where, in the name of uncommon things,\r\ndid you find such a handsome groom?\"\r\n\r\n\"I _was_ rather lucky,\" replied Miss Annesley in the same tongue.\r\n\"Don\u0027t you see something familiar about him?\"\r\n\r\nWarburton shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"Familiar? What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the groom who ran away with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heavens, no!\" Mrs. Chadwick raised her lorgnette. \"Whatever possessed\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mischief, as much as anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the risk!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not afraid. There was something about him that appeared very much\r\nlike a mystery, and you know how I adore mysteries.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this is the fellow we saw in the police-court, sitting among those\r\nlight o\u0027 loves?\" Mrs. Chadwick could not fully express her surprise.\r\n\r\n\"I can\u0027t analyze the impulse which prompted me to pay his fine and\r\nengage him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And after that affair at the carriage-door! Where is your pride?\"\r\n\r\n\"To tell the truth, I believe he did make a mistake. Maybe I hired him\r\nbecause I liked his looks.\" Betty glanced amusedly at the groom, whose\r\nneck and ears were red. She laughed.\r\n\r\n\"You always were an extraordinary child. I do not understand it in the\r\nleast. I am even worried. He may be a great criminal.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not a great criminal,\" said Betty, recollecting the ride of that\r\nmorning; \"but a first-class horseman, willing and obedient. I have been\r\nforced to make James serve as butler. He has been under the hands of\r\nour cook, and I have been watching them. How I have laughed! Of all\r\ndroll scenes!\"\r\n\r\nSo she had laughed, eh? Warburton\u0027s jaws snapped. She had been\r\nwatching, too?\r\n\r\n\"I rode Pirate this morning--\"\r\n\r\n\"You rode that horse?\" interrupted Mrs. Chadwick.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and he ran away with me in fine style. If it hadn\u0027t been for the\r\nnew groom, I shouldn\u0027t be here, and the dinner would be a dismal\r\nfailure, with me in bed with an arm or leg broken. Heavens! I never was\r\nso frightened in all my life. We went so fast against the wind that I\r\ncould scarce breathe. And when it was all over, I fainted like a ninny.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fainted! I should have thought you would. _I_ should have fallen off\r\nthe animal and been killed. Betty, you certainly have neither\r\nforethought nor discretion. The very idea of your attempting to ride\r\nthat animal!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I am wiser, and none the worse for the scare.... James, stop,\r\nstop!\" Betty cried suddenly.\r\n\r\nWhen this command struck his sense of hearing, James was pretty far\r\naway in thought. He was wondering if all this were true. If it was, he\r\nmust make the best of it; but if it was a dream, he wanted to wake up\r\nright away, because it was becoming nightmarish.\r\n\r\n\"James!\" The end of a parasol tickled him in the ribs and he drew up\r\nsomewhat frightened. What was going to happen now? He was soon to find\r\nout. For this was to be the real climax of the day; or at least, the\r\nincident was pregnant with the possibilities of a climax.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel, surely you are not going to pass us by in this fashion?\"\r\ncried the girl. They were almost opposite the Army and Navy Club.\r\n\r\n\"Why, is that you, Miss Betty? Pass you by? Only when I grow blind!\"\r\nroared a lion-like voice. \"Very glad to see you, Mrs. Chadwick.\"\r\n\r\nThat voice, of all the voices he had ever heard! A chill of\r\nindescribable terror flew up and down my jehu\u0027s spine, and his pores\r\nclosed up. He looked around cautiously. It was he, he of all men: his\r\nregimental colonel, who possessed the most remarkable memory of any\r\nArmy man west of the Mississippi, and who had often vowed that he knew\r\nhis subalterns so well that he could always successfully prescribe for\r\ntheir livers!\r\n\r\n\"I was just about to turn into the club for my mail,\" declared the\r\ncolonel. \"It was very good of you to stop me. I\u0027ll wager you\u0027ve been\r\nspeculating in the shops,\"--touching the bundles with his cane. \"You\r\nwin,\" laughed Betty. \"But I\u0027ll give you a hundred guesses in which to\r\nfind out what any of these packages contains.\"\r\n\r\n\"Guessing is a bad business. Whatever these things are, they can add\r\nbut little to the beauty of those who will wear them; for I presume\r\nMrs. Chadwick has some claim upon these bundles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very adroitly worded,\" smiled Mrs. Chadwick, who loved a silken phrase.\r\n\r\n\"We shall see you at dinner to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"All the battalions of England could not keep me away from that festive\r\nboard,\" the colonel vowed. (Another spasm for the groom!) \"And how is\r\nthat good father of yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"As kind and loving as ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you could have seen him in the old days in Virginia,\" said the\r\ncolonel, who, like all old men, continually fell back upon the\r\nreminiscent. \"Handsomest man in the brigade, and a fight made him as\r\nhappy as a bull-pup. I was with him the day he first met your\r\nmother,\"--softly. \"How she humiliated him because he wore the blue! She\r\nwas obliged to feed him--fortunes of war; but I could see that she\r\nhoped each mouthful would choke him.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! My mother wished that?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Chadwick laughed. The groom\u0027s chin sank into his collar.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a moment! She wasn\u0027t in love with him then. We were camped on\r\nthat beautiful Virginian home of yours for nearly a month. You know how\r\ncourtly he always was and is. Well, to every rebuff he replied with a\r\nsmile and some trifling favor. She never had to lift her finger about\r\nthe house. But one thing he was firm in: she should sit at the same\r\ntable during the meals. And when Johnston came thundering down that\r\nmemorable day, and your father was shot in the lungs and fell with a\r\ndozen saber cuts besides, you should have seen the change! He was the\r\nprisoner now, she the jailer. In her own white bed she had him placed,\r\nand for two months she nursed him. Ah, that was the prettiest love\r\naffair the world ever saw.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why have you not followed his example?\" asked Mrs. Chadwick.\r\n\r\nThe colonel gazed thoughtfully at his old comrade\u0027s daughter, and he\r\nsaw pity and unbounded respect in her eyes. \"They say that for every\r\nheart there is a mate, but I do not believe it. Sometimes there are two\r\nhearts that seek the same mate. One or the other must win or lose. You\r\nwill play for me to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"As often and as long as you please,\"--graciously. She was very fond of\r\nthis upright old soldier, whom she had known since babyhood.\r\n\r\nIt was now that the colonel casually turned his attention to the groom,\r\nHe observed him. First, his gray eyebrows arched abruptly in surprise,\r\nthen sank in puzzlement.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" inquired Betty, noting these signs.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing; nothing of importance,\" answered the colonel, growing\r\nviolently red.\r\n\r\nIt would not be exaggerating to say that if the colonel turned red, his\r\none-time orderly grew purple, only this purple faded quickly into a\r\nchalky pallor.\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps I am keeping you,\" remarked the colonel, soberly, \"I\r\nshall hold you to your promise about the music.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are to have plenty of music. There will foe a famous singer and a\r\nfine pianist.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will play that what-d\u0027-ye-call-it from Schumann I like so well. I\r\nshall want you to play that I want something in the way of memory to\r\ntake back West with me. Good-by, then, till to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-by. All right, James; home,\" said the girl. James relievedly\r\ntouched his horses.\r\n\r\nThe colonel remained standing at the curb till the victoria\r\ndisappeared. Of what he was thinking I don\u0027t know; but he finally\r\nmuttered \"James?\" in an inquiring way, and made for the club, shaking\r\nhis head, as if suddenly confronted by a remarkably abstruse problem.\r\n\r\nFurther on I shall tell you how he solved it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nRETROSPECTIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nShow me those invisible, imperceptible steps by which a man\u0027s honor\r\nfirst descends; show me the way back to the serene altitude of clean\r\nconscience, and I will undertake to enlighten you upon the secret of\r\nevery great historical event, tragic or otherwise. If you will search\r\nhistory carefully, you will note that the basic cause of all great\r\nevents, such as revolutions, civil strifes, political assassinations,\r\nforeign wars, and race oppressions, lay not in men\u0027s honor so much as\r\nin some one man\u0027s dishonor. A man, having committed a dishonorable act,\r\nmay reestablish himself in the eyes of his fellow-beings, but ever and\r\never he silently mocks himself and dares not look into the mirror of\r\nhis conscience.\r\n\r\nHonor is comparative, as every one will agree. It is only in the highly\r\ndeveloped mind that it reaches its superlative state. Either this man\r\nbecomes impregnable to the assaults of the angel of the pitch robes, or\r\nhe boldly plunges into the frightful blackness which surrounds her. The\r\ngreat greed of power, the great greed of wealth, the great greed of\r\nhate, the great greed of jealousy, and the great greed of love, only\r\nthese tempt him.\r\n\r\nNow, of dishonors, which does man hold in the greatest abhorrence? This\r\nquestion needs no pondering. It may be answered simply. The murderer,\r\nthe thief, and the rogue--we look upon these callously. But Judas!\r\nTreachery to our country! This is the nadir of dishonor; nothing could\r\nbe blacker. We never stop to look into the causes, nor does history,\r\nthat most upright and impartial of judges; we brand instantly. Who can\r\ntell the truth about Judas Iscariot, and Benedict Arnold, and the host\r\nof others? I can almost tolerate a Judas who betrays for a great love.\r\nThere seems to be a stupendous elimination of self in the man who\r\nbetrays for those he loves, braving the consequences, the ignominy, the\r\ndishonor, the wretchedness; otherwise I should not have undertaken to\r\nwrite this bit of history.\r\n\r\nTo betray a friend, that is bad; to betray a woman, that is still\r\nworse; but to betray one\u0027s country!-to commit an act which shall place\r\nher at the mercy of her enemies! Ah, the ignoble deaths of the men who\r\nwere guilty of this crime! And if men have souls, as we are told they\r\nhave, how the souls of these men must writhe as they look into the\r\nminds of living men and behold the horror and contempt in which each\r\ntraitor\u0027s name is held there!\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought of the legion of men who have been thrust back\r\nfrom the very foot of this precipice, either by circumstances or by the\r\nrevolt of conscience? These are the men who reestablish themselves in\r\nthe eyes of their fellow-beings, but who for ever silently mock\r\nthemselves and dare not look into the mirror of their consciences.\r\n\r\nIn this world motive is everything. A bad thing may be done for a good\r\npurpose, or, the other way around. This is the story of a crime, the\r\nmotive of which was good.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there lived a soldier, a gentleman born, a courtier, a\r\nman of fine senses, of high integrity, of tenderness, of courage; he\r\npossessed a splendid physical beauty, besides estates, and a\r\ncomfortable revenue, or rather, he presided over one. Above all this,\r\nhe was the father of a girl who worshiped him, and not without reason.\r\nWhat mysterious causes should set to work to ruin this man, to thrust\r\nhim from light into darkness? What step led him to attempt to betray\r\nhis country, even in times of peace, to dishonor his name, a name his\r\nhonesty had placed high on the rolls of glory? What defense can he\r\noffer? Well, I shall undertake to defend him; let yours be the verdict.\r\n\r\nEnforced idleness makes a criminal of a poor man; it urges the man of\r\nmeans to travel. Having seen his native land, it was only natural that\r\nmy defendant should desire to see foreign countries. So, accompanied by\r\nhis child, he went abroad, visited the famous capitals, and was the\r\nguest of honor at his country\u0027s embassies. It was a delightful period.\r\nBoth were as happy as fate ever allows a human being to be. The father\r\nhad received his honorable discharge, and till recently had held a\r\nresponsible position in the War Department. His knowledge had proved of\r\nno small value to the government, for he was a born strategist, and his\r\nhobby was the coast defenses. He never beheld a plan that he did not\r\nreproduce it on the back of an envelope, on any handy scrap of paper,\r\nand then pore over it through the night. He had committed to memory the\r\nsmallest details, the ammunition supplies of each fort, the number of\r\nguns, the garrison, the pregnable and impregnable sides. He knew the\r\nresource of each, too; that is to say, how quickly aid could be\r\nsecured, the nearest transportation routes, what forage might be had.\r\nHe had even submitted plans for a siege gun.\r\n\r\nOne day, in the course of their travels, the father and daughter\r\nstopped at Monte Carlo. Who hasn\u0027t heard of that city of fever? Who\r\nthat has seen it can easily forget its gay harbor, its beautiful walks,\r\nits crowds, its music, its hotels, its white temple of fortune? Now, my\r\ndefendant had hitherto ignored the principality of Monaco. The tales of\r\nterror which had reached his ears did not prepossess him in its favor.\r\nBut his daughter had friends there, and she wanted to see them. There\r\nwould be dances on the private yacht, and dinners, and teas, and\r\nfireworks. On the third night of his arrival he was joined by the owner\r\nof the yacht, a millionaire banker whose son was doing the honors as\r\nhost. I believe that there was a musicale on board that night, and as\r\nthe banker wasn\u0027t particularly fond of this sort of entertainment, he\r\ninveigled his soldier friend to accompany him on a sight-seeing trip.\r\nAt midnight they entered the temple of fortune. At first the soldier\r\ndemurred; but the banker told him that he hadn\u0027t seen Monte Carlo\r\nunless he saw the wheel go around. So, laughing, they entered the halls.\r\n\r\nThe passion for gaming is born in us all, man and woman alike, and is\r\nconceded by wise analysts to be the most furious of all passions and\r\nthe most lasting. In some, happily, the serpent sleeps for ever, the\r\nfire is for ever banked. But it needs only the opportunity to rouse the\r\ndull ember into flame, to stir the venom of the serpent. It seems a\r\nsimple thing to toss a coin on the roulette boards. Sometimes the act\r\nis done contemptuously, sometimes indifferently, sometimes in the\r\nspirit of fun and curiosity; but the result is always the same.\r\n\r\nThe banker played for a while, won and lost, lost and won. The soldier\r\nput his hand into a pocket and drew forth a five-franc piece. He placed\r\nit on a number. The angel in the pitch robes is always lying in wait\r\nfor man to make his first bad step; so she urged fortune to let this\r\nman win. It is an unwritten law, high up on Olympus, that the gods must\r\ngive to the gods; only the prayers of the mortals go unanswered.\r\n\r\nSo my defendant won. He laughed like a boy who had played marbles for\r\n\"keeps\" and had taken away his opponent\u0027s agates. His mind was\r\nperfectly innocent of any wrong-doing. That night he won a thousand\r\nfrancs. His real first bad step was in hiding the escapade from his\r\ndaughter. The following night he won again. Then he dallied about the\r\nflame till one night the lust of his forebears shone forth from his\r\neyes. The venom of the serpent spread, the ember grew into a flame. His\r\ndaughter, legitimately enjoying herself with the young people, knew\r\nnothing nor dreamed. Indeed, he never entered the temple till after he\r\nhad kissed her good night.\r\n\r\nHe lost. He lost twice, thrice, in succession. One morning he woke up\r\nto the fact that he was several thousand dollars on the wrong side of\r\nthe book. If the money had been his own, he would have stopped, and\r\ngone his way, cured. But it was money which he held in trust. He _must_\r\nreplace it. The angel in the pitch robes stood at his side; she even\r\nlaid a hand on his shoulder and urged him to win back what he had lost.\r\nThen indeed he could laugh, go his way, and gamble no more. This was\r\nexcellent advice. That winter he lost something like fifteen thousand.\r\nThen began the progress of decline. The following summer his losses\r\nwere even greater than before. He began to mortgage the estates, for\r\nhis authority over his daughter\u0027s property was absolute. He dabbled in\r\nstocks; a sudden fall in gold, and he realized that his daughter was\r\nnearly penniless. Ah, had he been alone, had the money been his, he\r\nwould have faced poverty with all the courage of a brave man. But the\r\ngirl, the girl! She must never know, she must never want for those\r\nluxuries to which she was accustomed. For her sake he must make one\r\nmore effort He _must_ win, must, must! He raised more money on the\r\nproperty. He became irritable, nervous, to which were added sudden\r\nbursts of tenderness which the girl could not very well understand.\r\n\r\nThe summer preceding the action of this tale saw them at Dieppe. At one\r\ntime he had recovered something between sixty and seventy thousand of\r\nhis losses. Ah, had he stopped then, confessed to his daughter, all\r\nwould have gone well But, no; he must win the entire sum. He lost,\r\nlost, lost. The crash came in August. But a corner of the vast\r\nVirginian estates was left, and this did not amount to twenty thousand.\r\nFive francs carelessly tossed upon a roulette table had ruined and\r\ndishonored him. The angel of the pitch robes had fairly enveloped him\r\nnow. The thought that he had gambled uselessly his daughter\u0027s legacy,\r\nthe legacy which her mother had left confidingly in his care, filled\r\nhis soul with the bitterness of gall. And she continued the merry round\r\nof happiness, purchasing expensive garments, jewelry, furs, the little\r\nthings which women love; gave dinners and teas and dances, considered\r\nherself an heiress, and thought the world a very pleasant place to live\r\nin. Every laugh from her was a thorn to him, the light of happiness in\r\nher eyes was a reproach, for he knew that she was dancing toward the\r\nprecipice which he had digged for her.\r\n\r\nStruggling futilely among these nettles of despair, he took the final\r\nstep. His ruin became definitive. His evil goddess saw to it that an\r\nopportunity should present itself. (How simple all this reads! As I\r\nread it over it does not seem credible. Think of a man who has reached\r\nthe height of his ambition, has dwelt there serenely, and then falls in\r\nthis silly, inexcusable fashion! Well, that is human nature, the human\r\npart of it. Only here and there do we fall grandly.)\r\n\r\nOne starlit night he met a distinguished young diplomat, rich and\r\nhandsome. He played some, but to pass away the time rather than to\r\ncoquet with fortune. He was lucky. The man who plays for the mere fun\r\nof it is generally lucky. He asks no favors from fortune; he does not\r\npay any attention to her, and, woman-like, she is piqued. He won\r\nheavily this night; my soldier lost correspondingly heavily. The\r\ndiplomat pressed a loan upon his new-found friend, who, with his usual\r\nluck, lost it.\r\n\r\nThe diplomat was presented to the daughter. They owned to mutual\r\nacquaintance in Paris and Washington. The three attended the concert.\r\nThe girl returned to the hotel bubbling with happiness and the echoes\r\nof enchanting melodies, for she was an accomplished musician. She\r\nretired and left the two men to their coffee and cigars. The\r\nconversation took several turns, and at length stopped at diplomacy.\r\n\r\n\"It has always puzzled me,\" said the soldier, \"how Russia finds out all\r\nshe does.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is easily explained. Russia has the wisdom of the serpent. Here\r\nis a man who possesses a secret which Russia must have. They study him.\r\nIf he is gallant, one day he meets a fascinating woman; if he is\r\ngreedy, he turns to find a bowl of gold at his elbow; if he seeks\r\npower, Russia points out the shortest road.\"\r\n\r\n\"But her knowledge of foreign army and naval strength?\"\r\n\r\n\"Money does all that. Russia possesses an accurate knowledge of every\r\nfort, ship and gun England boasts of; France, Germany, and Japan. We\r\nhave never taken it into our heads to investigate America. Till\r\nrecently your country as a foe to Russian interests had dropped below\r\nthe horizon. And now Russia finds that she must proceed to do what she\r\nhas done to all other countries; that is, duplicate her rival\u0027s\r\nfortification plans, her total military and naval strength; and so\r\nforth, and so on. The United States is not an enemy, but there are\r\npossibilities of her becoming so. Some day she must wrest Cuba from\r\nSpain, and then she may become a recognized quantity in the Pacific.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Pacific?\"\r\n\r\n\"Even so. Having taken Cuba, the United States, to protect her western\r\ncoast, will be forced to occupy the Philippines; and having taken that\r\narchipelago, she becomes a menace to Russian territorial expansion in\r\nthe far East. I do not always speak so frankly. But I wish you to see\r\nthe necessity of knowing all about your coast defenses.\"\r\n\r\n\"It can not be done!\"--spiritedly. So far the American had only gambled.\r\n\r\n\"It can and will be done,\" smiling. \"Despite the watchfulness of your\r\nofficials, despite your secret service, despite all obstacles, Russia\r\nwill quietly gain the required information. She possesses a key to\r\nevery lock.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what might this key be?\"--with tolerant irony.\r\n\r\n\"Gold.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if the United States found out what Russia was doing, there might\r\nbe war.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of the kind. Russia would simply deny all knowledge. The man\r\nwhom she selected to do the work would be discredited, banished,\r\nperhaps sent to Siberia to rot in the mines. No, there would be no war.\r\nRussia would weigh all these possibilities in selecting her arm. She\r\nwould choose a man of high intellect, rich, well-known in social\r\ncircles, a linguist, a man acquainted with all histories and all phases\r\nof life, a diplomat, perhaps young and pleasing. You will say, why does\r\nhe accept so base a task? When a Russian noble takes his oath in the\r\npresence of his czar, he becomes simply an arm; he no longer thinks,\r\nhis master thinks for him. He only acts. So long as he offers his\r\nservices without remuneration, his honor remains untouched, unsullied.\r\nA paid spy is the basest of all creatures.\"\r\n\r\n\"Count, take care that I do not warn my country of Russia\u0027s purpose.\r\nYou are telling me very strange things.\" The American eyed his\r\ncompanion sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Warn the United States? I tell you, it will not matter. All Russia\r\nwould need would be a dissatisfied clerk. What could he not do with\r\nhalf a million francs?\" The diplomat blew a cloud of smoke through his\r\nnostrils and filliped the end of his cigarette.\r\n\r\n\"A hundred thousand dollars?\"\r\n\r\nThe diplomat glanced amusedly at his American friend. \"I suppose that\r\nsounds small enough to you rich Americans. But to a clerk it reads\r\nwealth.\"\r\n\r\nThe American was silent. A terrible thought flashed through his brain,\r\na thought that he repulsed almost immediately.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, I am only speculating; nothing has been done as yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then something _is_ going to be done?\" asked the American, clearing\r\nhis voice.\r\n\r\n\"One day or another. If we can not find the clerk, we shall look\r\nhigher. We should consider a million francs well invested. America is\r\nrapidly becoming a great power. But let us drop the subject and turn to\r\nsomething more agreeable to us both. Your daughter is charming. I\r\nhonestly confess to you that I have not met her equal in any country.\r\nPardon my presumption, but may I ask if she is engaged to be married?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to my knowledge,\"--vastly surprised and at the same time pleased.\r\n\r\n\"Are you averse to foreign alliances?\" The diplomat dipped the end of a\r\nfresh-lighted cigar into his coffee.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Count, I am not averse to foreign alliances, but I rather\r\nsuspect that my daughter is. This aversion might be overcome, however.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a vista was opened to this wretched father! If only she might\r\nmarry riches, how easily he might confess what he had done, how easily\r\nall this despair and terror might be dispersed! And here was a man who\r\nwas known in the great world, rich, young and handsome.\r\n\r\nThe other gazed dreamily at the ceiling; from there his gaze traveled\r\nabout the coffee-room, with its gathering of coffee-drinkers, and at\r\nlength came back to his _vis-a-vis_.\r\n\r\n\"You will return to Washington?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I shall live there for the winter; that is, I expect to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless we shall see each other this winter, then,\"--and the count\r\nthrew away his cigar, bade his companion good night, and went to his\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nHow adroitly he had sown the seed! At that period he had no positive\r\nidea upon what kind of ground he had cast it. But he took that chance\r\nwhich all far-sighted men take, and then waited. There was little he\r\nhad not learned about this handsome American with the beautiful\r\ndaughter. How he had learned will always remain dark to me. My own\r\nopinion is that he had been studying him during his tenure of office in\r\nWashington, and, with that patience which is making Russia so\r\nformidable, waited for this opportunity.\r\n\r\nI shall give the Russian all the justice of impartiality. When he saw\r\nthe girl, he rather shrank from the affair. But he had gone too far, he\r\nhad promised too much; to withdraw now meant his own defeat, his\r\ngovernment\u0027s anger, his political oblivion. And there was a zest in\r\nthis life of his. He could no more resist the call of intrigue than a\r\ngambler can resist the croupier\u0027s, \"Make your game, gentlemen!\" I\r\nbelieve that he loved the girl the moment he set eyes upon her. Her\r\nbeauty and bearing distinguished her from the other women he had met,\r\nand her personality was so engaging that her conquest of him was\r\ncomplete and spontaneous. How to win this girl and at the same time\r\nruin her father was an embarrassing problem. The plan which finally\r\ncame to him he repelled again and again, but at length he surrendered.\r\nTo get the parent in his power and then to coerce the girl in case she\r\nrefused him! To my knowledge this affair was the first dishonorable act\r\nof a very honorable man. But love makes fools and rogues of us all.\r\n\r\nYou will question my right to call this diplomat an honest man. As I\r\nhave said elsewhere, honor is comparative. Besides, a diplomat\r\ngenerally falls into the habit of lying successfully to himself.\r\n\r\nWhen the American returned to the world, his cigar was out and his\r\ncoffee was stale and cold.\r\n\r\n\"A million francs!\" he murmured. \"Two hundred thousand!\"\r\n\r\nThe seed had fallen on fruitful ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nTHE PREVIOUS AFFAIR\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Chadwick had completed her toilet and now stood smiling in a most\r\nfriendly fashion at the reflection in the long oval mirror. She\r\naddressed this reflection in melodious tones.\r\n\r\n\"Madam, you are really handsome; and let no false modesty whisper in\r\nyour ear that you are not. Few women in Washington have such clear\r\nskin, such firm flesh, such color. Thirty-eight? It is nothing. It is\r\nbut the half-way post; one has left youth behind, but one has not\r\nreached old age. Time must be very tolerant, for he has given you a\r\ncareful selection. There were no years of storm and poverty, of violent\r\npassions; and if I have truly loved, it has been you, only you. You are\r\ntoo wise and worldly to love any one but yourself. And yet, once you\r\nstood on the precipice of dark eyes, pale skin, and melancholy\r\nwrinkles. And even now, if he were to speak... Enough! Enough of this\r\nfolly. I have something to accomplish to-night.\" She glided from the\r\nboudoir into the small but luxurious drawing-room which had often been\r\ngraced by the most notable men and women in the country.\r\n\r\nKarloff threw aside the book of poems by De Banville, rose, and went\r\nforward to meet her.\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\"--bending and brushing her hand with his lips, \"Madam, you grow\r\nhandsomer every day. If I were forty, now, I should fear for your\r\nsingle blessedness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or, if I were two-and-twenty, instead of eight-and-thirty,\"--beginning\r\nto draw on her long white gloves. There was a challenge in her smile.\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes; if you were two-and-twenty.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was a time, not so long ago,\" she said, drawing his gaze as a\r\nmagnet draws a needle, \"when the disparity in years was of no matter.\"\r\n\r\nThe count laughed. \"That was three years ago; and, if my memory serves\r\nme, you smiled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I was first to smile; that is all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I observe a mental reservation,\"--owlishly.\r\n\r\n\"I will put it plainly, then. I preferred to smile over your\r\nprotestations rather than see you laugh over the possibility and the\r\nfolly of my loving you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it was possible?\"--with interest.\r\n\r\n\"Everything is possible ... and often absurd.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that I was not truly in love with you?\"--narrowing his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"It is not explanatory; it can be given only one name--instinct, which\r\nin women and animals is more fully developed than in man. Besides, at\r\nthat time you had not learned all about Colonel Annesley, whose guests\r\nwe are to be this evening. Whoever would have imagined a Karloff\r\naccepting the hospitalities of an Annesley? Count, hath not thy rose a\r\ncanker?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam!\" Karloff was frowning.\r\n\r\n\"Count, you look like a paladin when you scowl; but scowling never\r\ninduces anything but wrinkles. That is why we women frown so seldom. We\r\nsmile. But let us return to your query. Supposing I had accepted your\r\ndeclarations seriously; supposing you had offered me marriage in that\r\nburst of gratitude; supposing I _had_ committed the folly of becoming a\r\ncountess: what a position I should be in to-day!\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand,\"--perplexedly.\r\n\r\n\"No?\"--shrugging. She held forth a gloved arm. \"Have you forgotten how\r\ngallantly you used to button my gloves?\"\r\n\r\n\"A thousand pardons! My mind was occupied with the mystery of your long\r\nsupposition.\" He took the arm gracefully and proceeded to slip the\r\npearl buttons through their holes. (Have you ever buttoned the gloves\r\nof a handsome woman? I have. And there is a subtile thrill about the\r\nproceeding which I can not quite define. Perhaps it is the nearness of\r\nphysical beauty; perhaps it is the delicate scent of flowers; perhaps\r\nit is the touch of the cool, firm flesh; perhaps it is just romance.)\r\nThe gaze which she bent upon his dark head was emotional; yet there was\r\nnot the slightest tremor of arm or fingers. It is possible that she\r\ndesired him to observe the steadiness of her nerves. \"What did you\r\nmean?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"What did I mean?\"--vaguely. Her thought had been elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\"By that supposition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I mean that my position, had I married you, would have been rather\r\nanomalous to-day.\" She extended the other arm. \"You are in love.\"\r\n\r\n\"In love?\" He looked up quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Decidedly; and I had always doubted your capacity for that sentiment.\"\r\n\r\n\"And pray tell me, with whom am I in love?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, Count, you and I know each other too well to waste time in\r\nbeating about the bushes. I do not blame you for loving her; only, I\r\nsay, it must not be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Must not be?\" The count\u0027s voice rose a key.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, must not be. You must give them up--the idea and the girl. What!\r\nYou, who contrive the father\u0027s dishonor, would aspire to the daughter\u0027s\r\nhand? It is not equable. Love her honorably, or not at all. The course\r\nyou are following is base and wholly unworthy of you.\"\r\n\r\nHe dropped the arm abruptly and strode across the room, stopping by a\r\nwindow. He did not wish her to see his face at that particular instant.\r\nSome men would have demanded indignantly to know how she had learned\r\nthese things; not so the count.\r\n\r\n\"There is time to retrieve. Go to the colonel frankly, pay his debts\r\nout of your own pockets, then tell the girl that you love her. Before\r\nyou tell her, her father will have acquainted her with his sin and your\r\ngenerosity. She will marry you out of gratitude.\"\r\n\r\nKarloff spun on his heels. His expression was wholly new. His eyes were\r\nburning; he stretched and crumpled his gloves.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you are right, you are right! I have been trying to convince\r\nmyself that I was a machine where the father was concerned and wholly a\r\nman in regard to the girl. You have put it before me in a bold manner.\r\nGood God, yes! I find that I am wholly a man. How smoothly all this\r\nwould have gone to the end had she not crossed my path! I _am_ base, I,\r\nwho have always considered myself an honorable man. And now it is too\r\nlate, too late!\"\r\n\r\n\"Too late? What do you mean? Have you dared to ask her to be your\r\nwife?\" Had Karloff held her arm at this moment, he would have\r\ncomprehended many things.\r\n\r\n\"No, no! My word has gone forth to my government; there is a wall\r\nbehind me, and I can not go back. To stop means worse than death. My\r\nproperty will be confiscated and my name obliterated, my body rot\r\nslowly in the frozen north. Oh, I know my country; one does not gain\r\nher gratitude by failure. I must have those plans, and nowhere could I\r\nobtain such perfect ones.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you will give her up?\" There was a broken note.\r\n\r\nThe count smiled. To her it was a smile scarce less than a snarl.\r\n\r\n\"Give her up? Yes, as a mother gives up her child, as a lioness her\r\ncub. She _has_ refused me, but nevertheless she shall be my wife. Oh, I\r\nam well-versed in human nature. She loves her father, and I know what\r\nsacrifices she would make to save his honor. To-night!--\" But his lips\r\nsuddenly closed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, to-night? Why do you not go on?\" Mrs. Chadwick was pale. Her\r\ngloved hands were clenched. A spasm of some sort seemed to hold her in\r\nits shaking grasp.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, nothing! In heaven\u0027s name, why have you stirred me so?\" he\r\ncried.\r\n\r\n\"Supposing, after all, I loved you?\"\r\n\r\nHe retreated. \"Madam, your suppositions are becoming intolerable and\r\nimpossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is impossible. Supposing I loved you as violently and\r\npassionately as you love this girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\"--hastily and with gentleness, \"do not say anything which may\r\ncause me to blush for you; say nothing you may regret to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a woman of circumspection. My suppositions are merely\r\nargumentative. Do you realize, Count, that I could force you to marry\r\nme?\"\r\n\r\nKarloff\u0027s astonishment could not be equaled. \"Force me to marry you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the thought so distasteful, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mad to-night!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so. In whatever manner you have succeeded in this country, your\r\ndebt of gratitude is owing to me. I do not recall this fact as a\r\nreproach; I make the statement to bear me on in what I have to submit\r\nto your discerning intelligence. I doubt if there is another woman,\r\nhere or abroad, who knows you so well as I. Your personal honor is\r\nbeyond impeachment, but Russia is making vast efforts to speckle it.\r\nShe will succeed. Yes, I could force you to marry me. With a word I\r\ncould tumble your house of cards. I am a worldly woman, and not without\r\nwit and address. I possess every one of your letters, most of all have\r\nI treasured the extravagant ones. To some you signed your name. If you\r\nhave kept mine, you will observe that my given name might mean any one\r\nof a thousand women who are named \u0027Grace.\u0027 Shall you marry me? Shall I\r\ntumble your house of cards? I could go to Colonel Annesley and say to\r\nhim that if he delivers these plans to you, I shall denounce him to the\r\nsecret service officers. I might cause his utter financial ruin, but\r\nhis name would descend to his daughter untarnished.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would not dare!\" the count interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"What? And you know me so well? I have not given you my word to reveal\r\nnothing. You confided in my rare quality of silence; you confided in me\r\nbecause you had proved me. Man is not infallible, even when he is named\r\nKarloff.\" She lifted from a vase her flowers, from which she shook the\r\nwater. \"Laws have been passed or annulled; laws have died at the\r\nexecutive desk. Who told you that this was to be, or that, long before\r\nit came to pass? In all the successful intrigues of Russia in this\r\ncountry, whom have you to thank? Me. Ordinarily a woman does not do\r\nthese things as a pastime. There must be some strong motive behind. You\r\nasked me why I have stirred you so. Perhaps it is because I am neither\r\ntwo-and-twenty nor you two-score. It is these little barbs that remain\r\nin a woman\u0027s heart. Well, I do not love you well enough to marry you,\r\nbut I love you too well to permit you to marry Miss Annesley.\"\r\n\r\n\"That has the sound of war. I _did_ love you that night,\"--not without\r\na certain nobility.\r\n\r\n\"How easily you say \u0027that night\u0027! Surely there was wisdom in that smile\r\nof mine. And I nearly tumbled into the pit! I must have looked\r\nexceedingly well... _that night!_\"--drily.\r\n\r\n\"You are very bitter to-night. Had you taken me at my word, I never\r\nshould have looked at Miss Annesley. And had I ceased to love you, not\r\neven you would have known it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible?\"--ironically.\r\n\r\n\"It is. I have too much pride to permit a woman to see that I have made\r\na mistake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you consider in the present instance that you have not made a\r\nmistake? You are frank.\"\r\n\r\n\"At least I have not made a mistake which I can not rectify. Madam, let\r\nus not be enemies. As you say, I owe you too much. What is it you\r\ndesire?\"--with forced amiability.\r\n\r\n\"Deprive Colonel Annesley of his honor, that, as you say, is\r\ninevitable; but I love that girl as I would a child of my own, and I\r\nwill not see her caught in a net of this sort, or wedded to a man whose\r\ngovernment robs him of his manhood and individuality.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not forget that I hold my country first and foremost,\"--proudly.\r\n\r\n\"Love has no country, nor laws, nor galling chains of incertitude. Love\r\nis magnificent only in that it gives all without question. You love\r\nthis girl with reservations. You shall not have her. You shall not have\r\neven me, who love you after a fashion, for I could never look upon you\r\nas a husband; in my eyes you would always be an accomplice.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is war, then?\"--curtly.\r\n\r\n\"War? Oh, no; we merely sever our diplomatic relations,\" she purred.\r\n\r\n\"Madam, listen to me. I shall make one more attempt to win this girl\r\nhonorably. For you are right: love to be love must be magnificent. If\r\nshe accepts me, for her sake I will become an outcast, a man without a\r\ncountry. If she refuses me, I shall go on to the end. Speak to the\r\ncolonel, Madam; it is too late. Like myself, he has gone too far. Why\r\ndid you open the way for me as you did? I should have been satisfied\r\nwith a discontented clerk. You threw this girl across my path,\r\nindirectly, it is true; but nevertheless the fault is yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"I recognize it. At that time I did not realize how much you were to\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a strange woman. I do not understand you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Incompatibility. Come, the carriage is waiting. Let us be gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have spoilt the evening for me,\" said the count, as he threw her\r\ncloak across her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, I have added a peculiar zest. Now, let us go and\r\nappear before the world, and smile, and laugh, and eat, and gossip. Let\r\nthe heart throb with a dull pain, if it will; the mask is ours to do\r\nwith as we may.\"\r\n\r\nThey were, in my opinion, two very unusual persons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Lay the rose on the table\"--Act II.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nDINNER IS SERVED\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur Pierre, having uttered this ejaculation, stepped back and\r\nrested his fat hands on his fat hips. As he surveyed the impromptu\r\nbutler, a shade of perplexity spread over his oily face. He smoothed\r\nhis imperial and frowned. This groom certainly _looked_ right, but\r\nthere was something lacking in his make-up, that indefinable something\r\nwhich is always found in the true servant--servility. There was no\r\nhumility here, no hypocritical meekness, no suavity; there was nothing\r\nsmug or self-satisfied. In truth, there was something grimly earnest,\r\nwhich was not to be understood readily. Monsieur Pierre, having always\r\nbusied himself with soups and curries and roasts and sauces, was not a\r\nprofound analyst; yet his instinctive shrewdness at once told him that\r\nthis fellow was no servant, nor could he ever be made into one. Though\r\nvoluble enough in his kitchen, Monsieur Pierre lacked expression when\r\nconfronted by any problem outside of it. Here was the regulation\r\nswallow-tail coat and trousers of green, the striped red vest, and the\r\npolished brass buttons; but the man inside was too much for him.\r\n\r\n\"_Diable_! you _luke_ right. But, no, I can not explain. Eet ees on zee\r\ntongue, but eet rayfuse. Ha! I haf eet! You lack vot zay call zee real.\r\nYou make me t\u0027ink uf zee sairvant on zee stage, somet\u0027ing bettair off;\r\neh?\" This was as near as monsieur ever got to the truth of things.\r\n\r\nDuring this speculative inventory, Warburton\u0027s face was gravely set;\r\nindeed, it pictured his exact feelings. He _was_ grave. He even wanted\r\nPierre\u0027s approval. He was about to pass through a very trying ordeal;\r\nhe might not even pass through it. There was no deceiving his colonel\u0027s\r\neyes, hang him! Whatever had induced fate to force this old Argus-eyed\r\nsoldier upon the scene? He glanced into the kitchen mirror. He\r\ninstantly saw the salient flaw in his dress. It was the cravat. Tie it\r\nas he would, it never approached the likeness of the conventional\r\ncravat of the waiter. It still remained a polished cravat, a worldly\r\ncravat, the cravat seen in ball-rooms, drawing-rooms, in the theater\r\nstalls and boxes, anywhere but in the servants\u0027 hall. Oh, for the\r\nready-made cravat that hitched to the collar-button! And then there was\r\nthat servant\u0027s low turned-down collar, glossy as celluloid. He felt as\r\ndiffident in his bare throat as a debutante feels in her first\r\ndecollete ball-gown, not very well covered up, as it were. And, heaven\r\nand earth, how appallingly large his hands had grown, how clumsy his\r\nfeet! Would the colonel expose him? Would he keep silent? This remained\r\nto be found out: wherein lay the terror of suspense.\r\n\r\n\"Remem_bair_,\" went on Monsieur Pierre, after a pause, feeling that he\r\nhad a duty to fulfil and a responsibility to shift to other shoulders\r\nthan his own, \"remem_bair_, eef you spill zee soup, I keel you. You\r\ncarry zee tureen in, zen you deesh out zee soup, and sairve. Zee\r\noystaires should be on zee table t\u0027ree minutes before zee guests haf\r\narrive\u0027. Now, can you make zee American cocktail?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can,\"--with a ghost of a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Make heem,\"--with a pompous wave of the hand toward the favorite\r\ningredients.\r\n\r\n\"What kind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Vot kind! Eez zare more cocktails, zen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only two that are proper, the manhattan and the martini.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make zee martini; I know heem.\"\r\n\r\n\"But cocktails ought not be mixed before serving.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, make zee one cocktail,\"--coldly and skeptically. \"I test heem.\"\r\n\r\nWarburton made one. Monsieur sipped it slowly, making a wry face, for,\r\ntrue Gaul that he was, only two kinds of stimulants appealed to his\r\npalate, liqueurs and wines. He found it as good as any he had ever\r\ntasted.\r\n\r\n\"Ver\u0027 good,\"--softening. \"Zare ees, zen, one t\u0027ing zat all zee\r\nAmericans can make, zee cocktail? I am educate\u0027; I learn. Now leaf me\r\ntill eight. Keep zee collect head;\"--and Monsieur Pierre turned his\r\nattention to his partridges.\r\n\r\nJames went out of doors to get a breath of fresh air and to collect his\r\nthoughts, which were wool-gathering, whatever that may mean. They\r\nneeded collecting, these thoughts of his, and labeling, for they were\r\nat all points of the compass, and he was at a loss upon which to draw\r\nfor support. Here he was, in a devil of a fix, and no possible way of\r\nescaping except by absolutely bolting; and he vowed that he wouldn\u0027t\r\nbolt, not if he stood the chance of being exposed fifty times over. He\r\nhad danced; he was going to pay the fiddler like a man. He had never\r\nrun away from anything, and he wasn\u0027t going to begin now.\r\n\r\nAt the worst, they could only laugh at him; but his secret would be his\r\nno longer. Ass that he had been! How to tell this girl that he loved\r\nher? How to appear to her as his natural self? What a chance he had\r\nwilfully thrown away! He might have been a guest to-night; he might\r\nhave sat next to her, turned the pages of her music, and perhaps sighed\r\nlove in her ear, all of which would have been very proper and\r\nconventional. Ah, if he only knew what was going on behind those\r\nMediterranean eyes of hers, those heavenly sapphires. Had she any\r\nsuspicion? No, it could not be possible; she had humiliated him too\r\noften, to suspect the imposture. Alackaday!\r\n\r\nHad any one else applied the disreputable terms he applied to himself\r\nthere would have been a battle royal. When he became out of breath, he\r\nreentered the house to have a final look at the table before the ordeal\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nCovers had been laid for twelve; immaculate linen, beautiful silver,\r\nand sparkling cut-glass. He wondered how much the girl was worth, and\r\nthought of his own miserable forty-five hundred the year. True, his\r\ncapital could at any time be converted into cash, some seventy-five\r\nthousand, but it would be no longer the goose with the golden egg. A\r\ngreat bowl of roses stood on a glass center-piece. As he leaned toward\r\nthem to inhale their perfume he heard a sound. He turned.\r\n\r\nShe stood framed in a doorway, a picture such as artists conjure up to\r\nfit in sunlit corners of gloomy studios: beauty, youth, radiance,\r\nluster, happiness. To his ardent eyes she was supremely beautiful. How\r\nwildly his heart beat! This was the first time he had seen her in all\r\nher glory. His emotion was so strong that he did not observe that she\r\nwas biting her nether lip.\r\n\r\n\"Is everything well, James?\" she asked, meaning the possibilities of\r\nservice and not the cardiac intranquillity of the servant.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Miss Annesley,\"--with a sudden bold scrutiny.\r\n\r\nWhatever it was she saw in his eyes it had the effect of making hers\r\nturn aside. To bridge the awkwardness of the moment, he rearranged a\r\nnapkin; and she remarked his hands. They were tanned, but they were\r\nelegantly shaped and scrupulously well taken care of--the hands of a\r\ngentleman born, of an aristocrat. He could feel her gaze penetrate like\r\nacid. He grew visibly nervous.\r\n\r\n\"You haven\u0027t the hand of a servant, James,\"--quietly.\r\n\r\nHe started, and knocked a fork to the floor.\r\n\r\n\"They are too clumsy,\" she went on maliciously.\r\n\r\n\"I am not a butler, Miss; I am a groom. I promise to do the very best I\r\ncan.\" Wrath mingled with the shame on his face.\r\n\r\n\"A man who can do what you did this morning ought not to be afraid of a\r\ndinner-table.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is some difference between a dinner-table and a horse, Miss.\" He\r\nstooped to recover the fork while she touched her lips with her\r\nhandkerchief. The situation was becoming unendurable. He knew that, for\r\nsome reason, she was quietly laughing at him.\r\n\r\n\"Never put back on the table a fork or piece of silver that has fallen\r\nto the floor,\" she advised. \"Procure a clean one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Miss.\" Why, in heaven\u0027s name, didn\u0027t she go and leave him in\r\npeace?\r\n\r\n\"And be very careful not to spill a drop of the burgundy. It is\r\nseventy-eight, and a particular favorite of my father\u0027s.\"\r\n\r\nSeventy-eight! As if he hadn\u0027t had many a bottle of that superb vintage\r\nduring the past ten months! The glands in his teeth opened at the\r\nmemory of that taste.\r\n\r\n\"James, we have been in the habit of paying off the servants on this\r\nday of the month. Payday comes especially happy this time. It will put\r\ngood feeling into all, and make the service vastly more expeditious.\"\r\n\r\nShe counted out four ten-dollar notes from a roll in her hand and\r\nsignified him to approach. He took the money, coolly counted it, and\r\nput it in his vest-pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Miss.\"\r\n\r\nI do not say that she looked disappointed, but I assert that she was\r\nslightly disconcerted. She never knew the effort he had put forth to\r\nsubdue the desire to tear the money into shreds, throw it at her feet\r\nand leave the house.\r\n\r\n\"When the gentlemen wish for cigars or cigarettes, you will find them\r\nin the usual place, the tower drawer in the sideboard.\" With a swish\r\nshe was gone.\r\n\r\nHe took the money out and studied it. No, he wouldn\u0027t tear it up;\r\nrather he would put it among his keepsakes.\r\n\r\nI shall leave Mr. Robert, or M\u0027sieu Zhames, to recover his\r\ntranquillity, and describe to you the character and quality of the\r\nguests. There was the affable military attache of the British embassy,\r\nthere was a celebrated American countess, a famous dramatist and his\r\nmusical wife, Warburton\u0027s late commanding colonel, Mrs. Chadwick, Count\r\nKarloff, one of the notable grand opera prima-donnas, who would not\r\nsing in opera till February, a cabinet officer and his wife, Colonel\r\nAnnesley and his daughter. You will note the cosmopolitan character of\r\nthese distinguished persons. Perhaps in no other city in America could\r\nthey be brought together at an informal dinner such as this one was.\r\nThere was no question of precedence or any such nonsense. Everybody\r\nknew everybody else, with one exception. Colonel Raleigh was a\r\ncomparative stranger. But he was a likable old fellow, full of stories\r\nof the wild, free West, an excellent listener besides, who always\r\nstopped a goodly distance on the right side of what is known in polite\r\ncircles as the bore\u0027s dead-line. Warburton held for him a deep\r\naffection, martinet though he was, for he was singularly just and\r\nmerciful.\r\n\r\nThey had either drunk the cocktail or had set it aside untouched, and\r\nhad emptied the oyster shells, when the ordeal of the soup began. Very\r\nfew of those seated gave any attention to my butler. The first thing he\r\ndid was to drop the silver ladle. Only the girl saw this mishap. She\r\nlaughed; and Raleigh believed that he had told his story in an\r\nexceptionally taking manner. My butler quietly procured another ladle,\r\nand proceeded coolly enough. I must confess, however, that his coolness\r\nwas the result of a physical effort. The soup quivered and trembled\r\noutrageously, and more than once he felt the heat of the liquid on his\r\nthumb. This moment his face was pale, that moment it was red. But, as I\r\nremarked, few observed him. Why should they? Everybody had something to\r\nsay to everybody else; and a butler was only a machine anyway. Yet,\r\nthree persons occasionally looked in his direction: his late colonel,\r\nMrs. Chadwick, and the girl; each from a different angle of vision.\r\nThere was a scowl on the colonel\u0027s face, puzzlement on Mrs. Chadwick\u0027s,\r\nand I don\u0027t know what the girl\u0027s represented, not having been there\r\nwith my discerning eyes.\r\n\r\nOnce the American countess raised her lorgnette and murmured: \"What a\r\nhandsome butler!\"\r\n\r\nKarloff, who sat next to her, twisted his mustache and shrugged. He had\r\nseen handsome peasants before. They did not interest him. He glanced\r\nacross the table at the girl, and was much annoyed that she, too, was\r\ngazing at the butler, who had successfully completed the distribution\r\nof the soup and who now stood with folded arms by the sideboard. (How I\r\nshould have liked to see him!)\r\n\r\nWhen the butler took away the soup-plates, Colonel Raleigh turned to\r\nhis host.\r\n\r\n\"George, where the deuce did you pick up that butler?\"\r\n\r\nAnnesley looked vaguely across the table at his old comrade. He had\r\nbeen far away in thought. He had eaten nothing.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I asked you where the deuce you got that butler of yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Betty found him somewhere. Our own butler is away on a vacation. I\r\nhad not noticed him. Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if he doesn\u0027t look like a cub lieutenant of mine, I was born\r\nwithout recollection of faces.\"\r\n\r\n\"An orderly of yours, a lieutenant, did you say?\" asked Betty, with\r\nsmoldering fires in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is strange,\" she mused.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; very strange. He was a daredevil, if there ever was one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; best bump of location in the regiment, and the steadiest\r\nnerve,\"--dropping his voice.\r\n\r\nThe girl leaned on her lovely arms and observed him interestedly.\r\n\r\n\"A whole company got lost in a snowstorm one winter. You know that on\r\nthe prairie a snowstorm means that only a compass can tell you where\r\nyou are; and there wasn\u0027t one in the troop,--a bad piece of\r\ncarelessness on the captain\u0027s part. Well, this cub said _he\u0027d_ find the\r\nway back, and the captain wisely let him take the boys in hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" said the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Interested, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a soldier\u0027s daughter, and I love the recital of brave deeds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he did it. Four hours later they were being thawed out in the\r\nbarracks kitchens. Another hour and not one of them would have lived to\r\ntell the tale. The whisky they poured into my cub--\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he drink?\" she interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"Drink? Why, the next day he was going to lick the men who had poured\r\nthe stuff down his throat. A toddy once in a while; that was all he\r\never took. And how he loved a fight! He had the tenacity of a bulldog;\r\nonce he set his mind on getting something, he never let up till he got\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl trifled thoughtfully with a rose.\r\n\r\n\"Was he ever in any Indian fights?\" she asked, casually.\r\n\r\n\"Only scraps and the like. He went into the reservation alone one day\r\nand arrested a chief who had murdered a sheep-herder. It was a\r\nvolunteer job, and nine men out of ten would never have left the\r\nreservation alive. He was certainly a cool hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say,\"--smiling. She wanted to ask him if he had ever been hurt,\r\nthis daredevil of a lieutenant, but she could not bring the question to\r\nher lips. \"What did you say his name was?\"--innocently.\r\n\r\n\"Warburton, Robert Warburton.\"\r\n\r\nHere the butler came in with the birds. The girl\u0027s eyes followed him,\r\nhither and thither, her lips hidden behind the rose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nCAUGHT!\r\n\r\n\r\nKarloff came around to music. The dramatist\u0027s wife should play Tosti\u0027s\r\n_Ave Maria_, Miss Annesley should play the obligato on the violin and\r\nthe prima-donna should sing; but just at present the dramatist should\r\ntell them all about his new military play which was to be produced in\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\n\"Count, I beg to decline,\" laughed the dramatist. \"I should hardly dare\r\nto tell my plot before two such military experts as we have here. I\r\nshould be told to write the play all over again, and now it is too\r\nlate.\"\r\n\r\nWhenever Betty\u0027s glance fell on her father\u0027s face, the gladness in her\r\nown was somewhat dimmed. What was making that loved face so care-worn,\r\nthe mind so listless, the attitude so weary? But she was young; the\r\nspirits of youth never flow long in one direction. The repartee,\r\nbrilliant and at the same time with every sting withdrawn, flashed up\r\nand down the table like so many fireflies on a wet lawn in July, and\r\ndrew her irresistibly.\r\n\r\nAs the courses came and passed, so the conversation became less and\r\nless general; and by the time the ices were served the colonel had\r\nengaged his host, and the others divided into twos. Then coffee,\r\nliqueurs and cigars, when the ladies rose and trailed into the little\r\nTurkish room, where the \"distinguished-looking butler\" supplied them\r\nwith the amber juice.\r\n\r\nA dinner is a function where everybody talks and nobody eats. Some have\r\neaten before they come, some wish they had, and others dare not eat for\r\nfear of losing some of the gossip. I may be wrong, but I believe that\r\nhalf of these listless appetites are due to the natural confusion of\r\nforks.\r\n\r\nAfter the liqueurs my butler concluded that his labor was done, and he\r\noffered up a short prayer of thankfulness and relief. Heavens, what\r\nmad, fantastic impulses had seized him while he was passing the soup!\r\nSupposing he _had_ spilled the hot liquid down Karloff\u0027s back, or\r\npoured out a glass of burgundy for himself and drained it before them\r\nall, or slapped his late colonel on the back and asked him the state of\r\nhis liver? It was maddening, and he marveled at his escape. There\r\nhadn\u0027t been a real mishap. The colonel had only scowled at him; he was\r\nsafe. He passed secretly from the house and hung around the bow-window\r\nwhich let out on the low balcony. The window was open, and occasionally\r\nhe could hear a voice from beyond the room, which was dark.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those nights, those mild November nights, to which the\r\nnovelists of the old regime used to devote a whole page; the silvery\r\npallor on the landscape, the moon-mists, the round, white, inevitable\r\nmoon, the stirring breezes, the murmur of the few remaining leaves, and\r\nall that. But these busy days we have not the time to read nor the\r\ninclination to describe.\r\n\r\nSuddenly upon the stillness of the night the splendor of a human voice\r\nbroke forth; the prima-donna was trying her voice. A violin wailed a\r\nnote. A hand ran up and down the keys of the piano. Warburton held his\r\nbreath and waited. He had heard Tosti\u0027s _Ave Maria_ many times, but he\r\nnever will forget the manner in which it was sung that night. The\r\nsongstress was care-free and among persons she knew and liked, and she\r\nput her soul into that magnificent and mysterious throat of hers, And\r\nthrobbing all through the song was the vibrant, loving voice of the\r\nviolin. And when the human tones died away and the instruments ceased\r\nto speak, Warburton felt himself swallowing rapidly. Then came\r\nSchumann\u0027s _Traumerei_ on the strings, Handel\u0027s _Largo_, Grieg\u0027s\r\n_Papillon_, and a _ballade_ by Chaminade. Then again sang the\r\nprima-donna; old folksy songs, sketches from the operas grand and\r\nlight, _Faust_, _The Barber of Seville_, _La Fille de Madame Angot_. In\r\nall his days Warburton had never heard such music. Doubtless he\r\n_had_--even better; only at this period he was in love. The imagination\r\nof love\u0027s young dream is the most stretchable thing I know of.\r\nSeriously, however, he was a very good judge of music, and I am\r\nconvinced that what he heard was out of the ordinary.\r\n\r\nBut I must guide my story into the channel proper.\r\n\r\nDuring the music Karloff and Colonel Annesley drifted into the latter\u0027s\r\nstudy. What passed between them I gathered from bits recently dropped\r\nby Warburton.\r\n\r\n\"Good God, Karloff, what a net you have sprung about me!\" said the\r\ncolonel, despairingly.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Colonel, you have only to step out of it. It is the eleventh\r\nhour; it is not too late.\" But Karloff watched the colonel eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"How in God\u0027s name can I step out of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Simply reimburse me for that twenty thousand I advanced to you in good\r\nfaith, and nothing more need be said.\" The count\u0027s Slavonic eyes were\r\nhalf-lidded.\r\n\r\n\"To give you back that amount will leave me a beggar, an absolute\r\nbeggar, without a roof to shelter me. I am too old for the service, and\r\nbesides, I am physically incapacitated. If you should force me, I could\r\nnot meet my note save by selling the house my child was born in. Have\r\nyou discounted it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Why should I present it at the bank? It does not mature till next\r\nMonday, and I am in no need of money.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a wretch I am!\"\r\n\r\nKarloff raised his shoulders resignedly.\r\n\r\n\"My daughter!\"\r\n\r\n\"Or my ducats,\" whimsically quoted the count. \"Come, Colonel; do not\r\nwaste time in useless retrospection. He stumbles who looks back. I have\r\nbeen thinking of your daughter. I love her, deeply, eternally.\"\r\n\r\n\"You love her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I love her because she appeals to all that is young and good in\r\nme; because she represents the highest type of womanhood. With her as\r\nmy wife, why, I should be willing to renounce my country, and your\r\nindebtedness would be crossed out of existence with one stroke of the\r\npen.\"\r\n\r\nThe colonel\u0027s haggard face grew light with sudden hopefulness.\r\n\r\n\"I have been,\" the count went on, studying the ash of his cigar, \"till\r\nthis night what the world and my own conscience consider an honorable\r\nman. I have never wronged a man or woman personally. What I have done\r\non the order of duty does not agitate my conscience. I am simply a\r\nmachine. The moral responsibility rests with my czar. When I saw your\r\ndaughter, I deeply regretted that you were her father.\"\r\n\r\nThe colonel grew rigid in his chair.\r\n\r\n\"Do not misunderstand me. Before I saw her, you were but the key to\r\nwhat I desired. As her father the matter took on a personal side. I\r\ncould not very conscientiously make love to your daughter and at the\r\nsame time--\" Karloff left the sentence incomplete.\r\n\r\n\"And Betty?\"--in half a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"Has refused me,\"--quietly. \"But I have not given her up; no, I have\r\nnot given her up.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean to do?\"\r\n\r\nKarloff got up and walked about the room. \"Make her my wife,\"--simply.\r\nHe stooped and studied the titles of some of the books in the cases. He\r\nturned to find that the colonel had risen and was facing him with\r\nflaming eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I demand to know how you intend to accomplish this end,\" the colonel\r\nsaid. \"My daughter shall not be dragged into this trap.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow night I will explain everything; to-night,\r\nnothing,\"--imperturbably.\r\n\r\n\"Karloff, to-night I stand a ruined and dishonored man. My head, once\r\nheld so proudly before my fellow-men, is bowed with shame. The country\r\nI have fought and bled for I have in part betrayed. But not for my\r\ngain, not for my gain. No, no! Thank God that I can say that! Personal\r\ngreed has not tainted me. Alone, I should have gone serenely into some\r\npoor house and eked out an existence on my half-pay. But this child of\r\nmine, whom I love doubly, for her mother\u0027s sake and her own,--I would\r\ngladly cut off both arms to spare her a single pain, to keep her in the\r\nluxury which she still believes rightfully to be hers. When the fever\r\nof gaming possessed me, I should have told her. I did not; therein lies\r\nmy mistake, the mistake which has brought me to this horrible end.\r\nVirginius sacrificed his child to save her; I will sacrifice my honor\r\nto save mine from poverty. Force her to wed a man she does not love?\r\nNo. To-morrow night we shall complete this disgraceful bargain. The\r\nplans are all finished but one. Now leave me; I wish to be alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, it is my deep regret--\"\r\n\r\n\"Go; there is nothing more to be said.\"\r\n\r\nKarloff withdrew. He went soberly. There was nothing sneering nor\r\ncontemptuous in his attitude. Indeed, there was a frown of pity on his\r\nface. He recognized that circumstances had dragged down a noble man;\r\nthat chance had tricked him of his honor. How he hated his own evil\r\nplan! He squared his shoulders, determined once more to put it to the\r\ntouch to win or lose it all.\r\n\r\nHe found her at the bow-window, staring up at the moon. As I remarked,\r\nthis room was dark, and she did not instantly recognize him.\r\n\r\n\"I am moon-gazing,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Let me sigh for it with you. Perhaps together we may bring it down.\"\r\nThere was something very pleasing in the quality of his tone.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, it is you, Count? I could not see. But let us not sigh for the\r\nmoon; it would be useless. Does any one get his own wish-moon? Does it\r\nnot always hang so high, so far away?\"\r\n\r\n\"The music has affected you?\"\r\n\r\n\"As it always does. When I hear a voice like madam\u0027s, I grow sad, and a\r\npity for the great world surges over me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pity is the invisible embrace which enfolds all animate things. There\r\nis pity for the wretched, for the fool, for the innocent knave, for\r\nthose who are criminals by their own folly; pity for those who love\r\nwithout reward; pity that embraces ... even me.\"\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n\"Has it ever occurred to you that there are two beings in each of us;\r\nthat between these two there is a continual conflict, and that the\r\nvictor finally prints the victory on the face? For what lines and\r\nhaggards a man\u0027s face but the victory of the evil that is in him? For\r\nwhat makes the aged ruddy and smooth of face and clear of eye but the\r\nvictory of the good that is in him? It is so. I still love you; I still\r\nhave the courage to ask you to be my wife. Shall there be faces haggard\r\nor ruddy, lined or smooth?\"\r\n\r\nShe stepped inside. She did not comprehend all he said, and his face\r\nwas in the shadow--that is to say, unreadable.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry, very, very sorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"How easily you say that!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not easily; if only you knew how hard it comes, for I know that it\r\ninflicts a hurt,\"--gently. \"Ah, Count, why indeed do I not love\r\nyou?\"--impulsively, for at that time she held him in genuine regard.\r\n\"You represent all that a woman could desire in a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"You could learn,\"--with an eager step toward her.\r\n\r\n\"You do not believe that; you know that you do not. Love has nothing to\r\nlearn; the heart speaks, and that is all. My heart does not speak when\r\nI see you, and I shall never marry a man to whom it does not. You ask\r\nfor something which I can not give, and each time you ask you only add\r\nto the pain.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is finality?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh, well; then I must continue on to the end.\"\r\n\r\nShe interpreted this as a plaint of his coming loneliness.\r\n\r\n\"Here!\" she said. She held in her hands two red roses. She thrust one\r\ntoward him. \"That is all I may give you.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment he hesitated. There were thorns, invisible and stinging.\r\n\r\n\"Take it!\"\r\n\r\nHe accepted it, kissed it gravely, and hid it.\r\n\r\n\"This is the bitterest moment in my life, and doubly bitter because I\r\nlove you.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the portiere fell behind him, she locked her hands, grieving that\r\nall she could give him was an ephemeral flower. How many men had turned\r\nfrom her in this wise, even as she began to depend upon them for their\r\nfriendships! The dark room oppressed her and she stepped out once more\r\ninto the silver of moonshine. Have you ever beheld a lovely woman\r\nfondle a lovely rose? She drew it, pendent on its slender stem, slowly\r\nacross her lips, her eyes shining mistily with waking dreams. She\r\nbreathed in the perfume, then cupped the flower in the palm of her hand\r\nand pressed it again and again to her lips. A long white arm stretched\r\noutward and upward toward the moon, and when it withdrew the hand was\r\nempty.\r\n\r\nWarburton, hidden behind the vines, waited until she was gone, and then\r\nhunted in the grass for the precious flower. On his hands and knees he\r\ngroped. The dew did not matter. And when at last he found it, not all\r\nthe treasures of the fabled Ophir would have tempted him to part with\r\nit. It would be a souvenir for his later days.\r\n\r\nAs he rose from his knees he was confronted by a broad-shouldered,\r\nelderly man in evening clothes. The end of a cigar burned brightly\r\nbetween his teeth.\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027ll take that flower, young man, if you please.\"\r\n\r\nWarburton\u0027s surprise was too great for sudden recovery.\r\n\r\n\"It is mine, Colonel,\" he stammered.\r\n\r\nThe colonel filliped away his cigar and caught my butler roughly by the\r\narm.\r\n\r\n\"Warburton, what the devil does this mean--a lieutenant of mine\r\npeddling soup around a gentleman\u0027s table?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\n\"OH, MISTER BUTLER!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWarburton had never lacked that rare and peculiar gift of immediately\r\nadapting himself to circumstances. To lie now would be folly, worse\r\nthan useless. He had addressed this man at his side by his military\r\ntitle. He stood committed. He saw that he must throw himself wholly on\r\nthe colonel\u0027s mercy and his sense of the humorous. He pointed toward\r\nthe stables and drew the colonel after him; but the colonel held back.\r\n\r\n\"That rose first; I insist upon having that rose till you have given me\r\na satisfactory account of yourself.\"\r\n\r\nWarburton reluctantly surrendered his treasure. Force of habit is a\r\npeculiar one. The colonel had no real authority to demand the rose; but\r\nWarburton would no more have thought of disobeying than of running away.\r\n\r\n\"You will give it back to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"That remains to be seen. Go on; I am ready to follow you. And I do not\r\nwant any dragging story, either.\" The colonel spoke impatiently.\r\n\r\nWarburton led him into his room and turned on the light. The colonel\r\nseated himself on the edge of the cot and lighted a fresh cigar.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, out with it. I am waiting.\"\r\n\r\nWarburton took several turns about the room. \"I don\u0027t know how the\r\ndeuce to begin, Colonel. It began with a joke that turned out wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed?\"--sarcastically. \"Let me hear about this joke.\"\r\n\r\nM\u0027sieu Zhames dallied no longer, but plunged boldly into his narrative.\r\nSometimes the colonel stared at him as if he beheld a species of\r\nlunatic absolutely new to him, sometimes he laughed silently, sometimes\r\nhe frowned.\r\n\r\n\"That\u0027s all,\" said Zhames; and he stood watching the colonel with dread\r\nin his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Well, of all the damn fools!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of all the jackasses!\"\r\n\r\nWarburton bit his lip angrily.\r\n\r\nThe colonel swung the rose to and fro. \"Yes, sir, a damn fool!\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say that I am, sir. But I have gone too far to back out now.\r\nWill you give me back that rose, Colonel?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by her?\"--coldly.\r\n\r\n\"I love her with all my heart,\"--hotly. \"I want her for my comrade, my\r\nwife, my companion, my partner in all I have or do. I love her, and I\r\ndon\u0027t care a hang who knows it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so loud, my friend; not so loud.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I do not care who hears,\"--discouragedly.\r\n\r\n\"This beats the very devil! You\u0027ve got me all balled up. Is Betty\r\nAnnesley a girl of the kind we read about in the papers as eloping with\r\nher groom? What earthly chance had you in this guise, I should like to\r\nknow?\"\r\n\r\n\"I only wanted to be near her; I did not look ahead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I should say not! How long were you hidden behind that trellis?\"\r\n\r\n\"A year, so it seemed to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any lunatics among your ancestors?\"\r\n\r\nWarburton shook his head, smiling wanly.\r\n\r\n\"I can\u0027t make it out,\" declared the colonel. \"A graduate of West Point,\r\nthe fop of Troop A, the hero of a hundred ball-rooms, disguised as a\r\nhostler and serving soup!\"\r\n\r\n\"Always keep the motive in mind, Colonel; you were young yourself once.\"\r\n\r\nThe colonel thought of the girl\u0027s mother. Yes, he had been young once,\r\nbut not quite so young as this cub of his.\r\n\r\n\"What chance do you suppose you have against the handsome Russian?\"\r\n\r\n\"She has rejected him,\"--thoughtlessly.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\"--frowning; \"so you were eavesdropping?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a moment, Colonel. You know that I am very fond of music. I was\r\nlistening to the music. It had ceased, and I was waiting for it to\r\nbegin again, when I heard voices.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you not leave then?\"\r\n\r\n\"And be observed? I dared not.\"\r\n\r\nThe colonel chewed the end of his cigar in silence.\r\n\r\n\"And now may I have that rose, sir?\"--quietly.\r\n\r\nThe colonel observed him warily. He knew that quiet tone. It said that\r\nif he refused to give up the rose he would have to fight for it, and\r\nprobably get licked into the bargain.\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027ve a notion you might attempt to take it by force in case I refused.\"\r\n\r\n\"I surrendered it peacefully enough, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you did. Here.\" The colonel tossed the flower across the room and\r\nWarburton caught it.\r\n\r\n\"I should like to know, sir, if you are going to expose me. It\u0027s no\r\nmore than I deserve.\"\r\n\r\nThe colonel studied the lithographs on the walls. \"Your\r\nselection?\"--with a wave of the hand.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. I should like to know what you are going to do. It would\r\nrelieve my mind. As a matter of fact, I confess that I am growing weary\r\nof the mask.\" Warburton waited.\r\n\r\n\"You make a very respectable butler, though,\"--musingly.\r\n\r\n\"Shall you expose me, sir?\"--persistently.\r\n\r\n\"No, lad. I should not want it to get about that a former officer of\r\nmine could possibly make such an ass of himself. You have slept all\r\nnight in jail, you have groomed horses, you have worn a livery which no\r\ngentleman with any self-respect would wear, and all to no purpose\r\nwhatever. Why, in the name of the infernal regions, didn\u0027t you meet her\r\nin a formal way? There would have been plenty of opportunities.\"\r\n\r\nWarburton shrugged; so did the colonel, who stood up and shook the\r\nwrinkles from his trousers.\r\n\r\n\"Shall you be long in Washington, sir?\" asked Warburton, politely.\r\n\r\n\"In a hurry to get rid of me, eh?\"--with a grim smile. \"Well, perhaps\r\nin a few days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good night.\"\r\n\r\nThe colonel stopped at the threshold, and his face melted suddenly into\r\na warm, humorous smile. He stretched out a hand which Warburton grasped\r\nmost gratefully. His colonel had been playing with him.\r\n\r\n\"Come back to the Army, lad; the East is no place for a man of your\r\nkidney. Scrape up a commission, and I\u0027ll see to it that you get back\r\ninto the regiment. Life is real out in the great West. People smile too\r\nmuch here; they don\u0027t laugh often enough. Smiles have a hundred\r\nmeanings, laughter but one. Smiles are the hiding places for lies, and\r\nsneers, and mockeries, and scandals. Come back to the West; we all want\r\nyou, the service and I. When I saw you this afternoon I knew you\r\ninstantly, only I was worried as to what devilment you were up to. Win\r\nthis girl, if you can; she\u0027s worth any kind of struggle, God bless her!\r\nWin her and bring her out West, too.\"\r\n\r\nWarburton wrung the hand in his till the old fellow signified that his\r\nfingers were beginning to ache.\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose she suspects anything?\" ventured Warburton.\r\n\r\n\"No. She may be a trifle puzzled, though. I saw her watching your hands\r\nat the table. She has eyes and can readily see that such hands as yours\r\nwere never made to carry soup-plates. For the life of me, I had a time\r\nof it, swallowing my laughter. I longed for a vacant lot to yell in. It\r\nwould have been a positive relief. The fop of Troop A peddling soup!\r\nOh, I shall have to tell the boys. You used more pipe-clay than any\r\nother man in the regiment. Don\u0027t scowl. Never mind; you\u0027ve had your\r\njoke; I must have mine. Don\u0027t let that Russian fellow get the inside\r\ntrack. Keep her on American soil. I like him and I don\u0027t like him; and\r\nfor all your tomfoolery and mischief, there is good stuff in you--stuff\r\nthat any woman might be proud of. If you hadn\u0027t adopted this disguise,\r\nI could have helped you out a bit by cracking up some of your exploits.\r\nWell, they will be inquiring for me. Good night and good luck. If you\r\nshould need me, a note will find me at the Army and Navy Club.\" And the\r\ngenial old warrior, shaking with silent laughter, went back to the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nWarburton remained standing. He was lost in a dream. All at once he\r\npressed the rose to his lips and kissed it shamelessly, kissed it\r\nuncountable times. Two or three leaves, not withstanding this violent\r\ntreatment, fluttered to the floor. He picked them up: any one of those\r\nvelvet leaves might have been the recipient of _her_ kisses, the rosary\r\nof love. He was in love, such a love that comes but once to any man,\r\nnot passing, uncertain, but lasting. He knew that it was all useless.\r\nHe had digged with his own hands the abyss between himself and this\r\ngirl. But there was a secret gladness: to love was something. (For my\r\npart, I believe that the glory lies, not in being loved, but in loving.)\r\n\r\nI do not know how long he stood there, but it must have been at least\r\nten minutes. Then the door opened, and Monsieur Pierre lurched or\r\nrolled (I can\u0027t quite explain or describe the method of his entrance)\r\ninto the room, his face red with anger, and a million thousand thunders\r\non the tip of his Gallic tongue.\r\n\r\n\"So! You haf leaf _me_ to clear zee table, eh? Not by a damn! _I_,\r\nclear zee table? _I?_ I t\u0027ink not. I _cook_, nozzing else. To zee\r\ndining-room, or I haf you discharge\u0027!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Peter, old boy!\" cried Warburton, the gloom lifting from\r\nhis face. This Pierre was a very funny fellow.\r\n\r\n\"Pe_taire!_ You haf zee insolence to call me Pe_taire?_ Why, I haf you\r\nkeeked out in zee morning, lackey!\"\r\n\r\n\"Cook!\"--mockingly.\r\n\r\nPierre was literally dumfounded. Such disrespect he had never before\r\nwitnessed. It was frightful. He opened his mouth to issue a volley of\r\nFrench oaths, when Zhames\u0027s hand stopped him.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Peter, you broil your partridges and flavor your soups, but\r\nkeep out of the stables, or, in your own words, I _keel_ you or _keek_\r\nyou out. You tell the scullery maid to clear off the table. I\u0027m off\r\nduty for the rest of the night. Now, then, _allons! Marche!\"_\r\n\r\nAnd M\u0027sieu Zhames gently but firmly and steadily pushed the scandalized\r\nPierre out of the room and closed the door in his face. I shan\u0027t repeat\r\nwhat Pierre said, much less what he thought.\r\n\r\nLet me read a thought from the mind of each of my principals, the final\r\nthought before retiring that night.\r\n\r\n_Karloff_ (on leaving Mrs. Chadwick): Dishonor against dishonor; so it\r\nmust be. I can not live without that girl.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Chadwick:_ (when Karloff had gone); He has lost, but I have not\r\nwon.\r\n\r\n_Annesley:_ So one step leads to another, and the labyrinth of dishonor\r\nhas no end.\r\n\r\n_The Colonel:_ What the deuce will love put next into the young mind?\r\n\r\n_Pierre_ (to Celeste): I haf heem discharge\u0027!\r\n\r\n_Celeste_ (to Pierre): He ees handsome!\r\n\r\n_Warburton_ (sighing in the _doloroso_): How I love her!\r\n\r\n_The Girl_ (standing before her mirror and smiling happily): Oh, Mister\r\nButler! Why?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nTHE EPISODE OF THE STOVE-PIPE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the morning Monsieur Pierre faithfully reported to his mistress the\r\ngroom\u0027s extraordinary insolence and impudence of the night before. The\r\ngirl struggled with and conquered her desire to laugh; for monsieur was\r\nsomewhat grotesque in his rage.\r\n\r\n\"Frightful, Mademoiselle, most frightful! He call me Pe_taire_ most\r\ndisrrrespectful way, and eject me from zee stables. I can not call heem\r\nout; he ees a groom and knows nozzing uf zee _amende honorable._\"\r\n\r\nMademoiselle summoned M\u0027sieu Zhames. She desired to make the comedy\r\ncomplete in all its phases.\r\n\r\n\"James, whenever you are called upon to act in the capacity of butler,\r\nyou must clear the table after the guests leave it. This is imperative.\r\nI do not wish the scullery girl to handle the porcelain save in the\r\ntubs. Do you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Miss. There were no orders to that effect last night, however.\"\r\nHe was angry.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Pierre puffed up like the lady-frog in Aesop\u0027s fables,\r\n\r\n\"And listen, Pierre,\" she said, collapsing the bubble of the chef\u0027s\r\nconceit, \"you must give no orders to James. I will do that. I do not\r\nwish any tale-bearing or quarreling among my servants. I insist upon\r\nthis. Observe me carefully, Pierre, and you, James.\"\r\n\r\nJames _did_ observe her carefully, so carefully, indeed, that her gaze\r\nwas forced to wander to the humiliated countenance of Monsieur Pierre.\r\n\r\n\"James, you must not look at me like that. There is something in your\r\neyes; I can\u0027t explain what it is, but it somehow lacks the respect due\r\nme.\" This command was spoken coldly and sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Respect?\" He drew back a step. \"I disrespectful to you, Miss Annesley?\r\nOh, you wrong me. There can not be any one more respectful to you than\r\nI am.\" The sincerity of his tones could not be denied. In fact, he was\r\nalmost too sincere.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, I wish you to regard what I have said. Now, you two\r\nshake hands.\"\r\n\r\nThe groom and the chef shook hands. I am ashamed to say that James\r\nsqueezed Monsieur Pierre\u0027s flabby hand out of active service for\r\nseveral hours that followed. Beads of agony sparkled on Monsieur\r\nPierre\u0027s expansive brow as he turned to enter the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we ride to-day, Miss?\" he asked, inwardly amused.\r\n\r\n\"No, _I_ shall not ride this morning,\"--calmly.\r\n\r\nJames bowed meekly under the rebuke. What did he care? Did he not\r\npossess a rose which had known the pressure of her lips, her warm, red\r\nlips?\r\n\r\n\"You may go,\" she said.\r\n\r\nJames went. James whistled on the way, too.\r\n\r\nWould that it had been my good fortune to have witnessed the episode of\r\nthat afternoon! My jehu, when he hears it related these days, smiles a\r\nsickly grin. I do not believe that he ever laughed heartily over it. At\r\nthree o\u0027clock, while Warburton was reading the morning paper,\r\ninterested especially in the Army news of the day, he heard Pierre\u0027s\r\nvoice wailing.\r\n\r\n\"What\u0027s the fat fool want now?\" James grumbled to William.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he\u0027s always yelling for help. They\u0027ve coddled him so long in the\r\nfamily that he acts like a ten-year-old kid. I stole a kiss from\r\nCeleste one day, and I will be shot if he didn\u0027t start to blubber.\"\r\n\r\n\"You stole a kiss, eh?\" said James, admiringly.\r\n\r\n\"Only just for the sport of making him crazy, that was all.\" But\r\nWilliam\u0027s red visage belied his indifferent tone. \"You\u0027d better go and\r\nsee what he wants. My hands are all harness grease.\"\r\n\r\nWarburton concluded to follow William\u0027s advice. He flung down his paper\r\nand strode out to the rear porch, where he saw Pierre gesticulating\r\nwildly.\r\n\r\n\"What\u0027s the matter? What do you want?\"--churlishly.\r\n\r\n\"Frightful! Zee stove-pipe ees vat you call _bust!_\"\r\n\r\nJames laughed.\r\n\r\n\"I can not rrreach eet. I can not cook till eet ees fix\u0027. You are tall,\r\neh?\"--affably.\r\n\r\n\"All right; I\u0027ll help you fix it.\"\r\n\r\nGrumbling, James went into the kitchen, mounted a chair, and began\r\nbanging away at the pipe, very much after the fashion of Bunner\u0027s\r\n\"Culpepper Ferguson.\" The pipe acted piggishly. James grew determined.\r\nOne end slipped in and then the other slipped out, half a dozen times.\r\nJames lost patience and became angry; and in his anger he overreached\r\nhimself. The chair slid back. He tried to balance himself and, in the\r\nmad effort to maintain a perpendicular position, made a frantic clutch\r\nat the pipe. Ruin and devastation! Down came the pipe, and with it a\r\npeck of greasy soot.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Pierre yelled with terror and despair. The pies on the rear\r\nend of the stove were lost for ever. Mademoiselle Celeste screamed with\r\nlaughter, whether at the sight of the pies or M\u0027sieu Zhames, is more\r\nthan I can say.\r\n\r\nJames rose to his feet, the cuss-words of a corporal rumbled behind his\r\nlips. He sent an energetic kick toward Pierre, who succeeded in eluding\r\nit.\r\n\r\nPierre\u0027s eyes were full of tears. What a kitchen! What a kitchen! Soot,\r\nsoot, everywhere, on the floor, on the tables, on the walls, in the air!\r\n\r\n\"Zee pipe!\" he burst forth; \"zee pipe! You haf zee house full of gas!\"\r\n\r\nJames, blinking and sneezing, boiling with rage and chagrin, remounted\r\nthe chair and finally succeeded in joining the two lengths. Nothing\r\nhappened this time. But the door to the forward rooms opened, and Miss\r\nAnnesley looked in upon the scene.\r\n\r\n\"Merciful heavens!\" she gasped, \"what has happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Zee stove-pipe bust, Mees,\" explained Pierre.\r\n\r\nThe girl gave Warburton one look, balled her handkerchief against her\r\nmouth, and fled. This didn\u0027t add to his amiability. He left the kitchen\r\nin a downright savage mood. He had appeared before her positively\r\nridiculous, laughable. A woman never can love a man, nor entertain\r\ntender regard for him at whom she has laughed: And the girl had\r\nlaughed, and doubtless was still laughing. (However, I do not offer his\r\nopinion as infallible.)\r\n\r\nHe stood in the roadway, looking around for some inanimate thing upon\r\nwhich he might vent his anger, when the sound of hoofs coming toward\r\nhim distracted him. He glanced over his shoulder... and his knees all\r\nbut gave way under him. Caught! The rider was none other than his\r\nsister Nancy! It was all over now, for a certainty. He knew it; he had\r\nabout one minute to live. She was too near, so he dared not fly. Then a\r\nbrilliant inspiration came to him. He quickly passed his hand over his\r\nface. The disguise was complete. Vidocq\u0027s wonderful eye could not have\r\npenetrated to the flesh.\r\n\r\n\"James!\" Miss Annesley was standing on the veranda. \"Take charge of the\r\nhorse. Nancy, dear, I am so glad to see you!\"\r\n\r\nJames was anything but glad.\r\n\r\n\"Betty, good gracious, whatever is the matter with this fellow? Has he\r\nthe black plague? Ugh!\" She slid from the saddle unaided.\r\n\r\nJames stolidly took the reins.\r\n\r\n\"The kitchen stove-pipe fell down,\" Betty replied, \"and James stood in\r\nthe immediate vicinity of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe two girls laughed joyously, but James did not even smile. He had\r\nhalf a notion to kiss Nancy, as he had planned to do that memorable\r\nnight of the ball at the British embassy. But even as the notion came\r\nto him, Nancy had climbed up the steps and was out of harm\u0027s way.\r\n\r\n\"James,\" said Miss Annesley, \"go and wash your face at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Miss.\"\r\n\r\nAt the sound of his voice Nancy turned swiftly; but the groom had\r\npresented his back and was leading the horse to the stables.\r\n\r\nNancy would never tell me the substance of her conversation with Miss\r\nAnnesley that afternoon, but I am conceited enough to believe that a\r\ncertain absent gentleman was the main topic. When she left, it was\r\nWilliam who led out the horse. He explained that James was still\r\nengaged with soap and water and pumice-stone. Miss Annesley\u0027s laughter\r\nrang out heartily, and Nancy could not help joining her.\r\n\r\n\"And have you heard from that younger brother of yours?\" Betty asked,\r\nas her friend settled herself in the saddle.\r\n\r\n\"Not a line, Betty, not a line; and I had set my heart on your meeting\r\nhim. I do not know where he is, or when he will be back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he is in quest of adventures.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is in Canada, hunting caribou.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don\u0027t tell me!\"\r\n\r\n\"What a handsome girl you are, Betty!\"--admiringly.\r\n\r\n\"What a handsome girl you are, Nancy!\" mimicked the girl on the\r\nveranda. \"If your brother is only half as handsome, I do not know\r\nwhatever will become of this heart of mine when we finally meet.\" She\r\nsmiled and drolly placed her hands on her heart. \"Don\u0027t look so\r\ndisappointed, Nan; perhaps we may yet meet. I have an idea that he will\r\nprove interesting and entertaining;\"--and she laughed again.\r\n\r\n\"Whoa, Dandy! What _are_ you laughing at?\" demanded Nancy.\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking of James and his soap and water and pumice-stone. That\r\nwas all, dear. Saturday afternoon, then, we shall ride to the club and\r\nhave tea. Good-by, and remember me to the baby.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-by!\"--and Nancy cantered away.\r\n\r\nWhat a blissful thing the lack of prescience is, sometimes!\r\n\r\nWhen James had scraped the soot from his face and neck and hands, and\r\nhad sudsed it from his hair, James observed, with some concern, that\r\nPirate was coughing at a great rate. His fierce run against the wind\r\nthe day before had given him a cold. So James hunted about for the\r\nhandy veterinarian.\r\n\r\n\"Where do you keep your books here?\" he asked William. \"Pirate\u0027s got a\r\ncold.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the house library. You just go in and get it. We always do that at\r\nhome. You\u0027ll find it on the lower shelf, to the right as you enter the\r\ndoor.\"\r\n\r\nIt was half after four when James, having taken a final look at his\r\nhands and nails, proceeded to follow William\u0027s instructions. He found\r\nno one about. Outside the kitchen the lower part of the house was\r\ndeserted. To reach the library he had to pass through the music-room.\r\nHe saw the violin-case on the piano, and at once unconsciously pursed\r\nhis lips into a noiseless whistle. He passed on into the library. He\r\nhad never been in any of these rooms in the daytime. It was not very\r\nlight, even now.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that caught his attention was a movable drawing-board,\r\non which lay an uncompleted drawing. At one side stood a glass, into\r\nwhich were thrust numerous pens and brushes. Near this lay a small ball\r\nof crumpled cambric, such as women insist upon carrying in their\r\nstreet-car purses, a delicate, dainty, useless thing. So she drew\r\npictures, too, he thought. Was there anything this beautiful creature\r\ncould not do? Everything seemed to suggest her presence. An indefinable\r\nfeminine perfume still lingered on the air, speaking eloquently of her.\r\n\r\nCuriosity impelled him to step forward and examine her work. He\r\napproached with all the stealth of a gentlemanly burglar. He expected\r\nto see some trees and hills and mayhap a brook, or some cows standing\r\nin a stream, or some children picking daisies. He had a sister, and was\r\nreasonably familiar with the kind of subjects chosen by the\r\nlady-amateur.\r\n\r\nA fortification plan!\r\n\r\nHe bent close to it. Here was the sea, here was the land, here the\r\nnumber of soldiers, cannon, rounds of ammunition, resources in the\r\nmatter of procuring aid, the telegraph, the railways, everything was\r\nhere on this pale, waxen cloth, everything but a name. He stared at it,\r\nbewildered. He couldn\u0027t understand what a plan of this sort was doing\r\noutside the War Department. Instantly he became a soldier; he forgot\r\nthat he was masquerading as a groom; he forgot everything but this mute\r\nthing staring up into his face. Underneath, on a little shelf, he saw a\r\nstack of worn envelopes. He looked at them. Rough drafts of plans.\r\nGovernor\u0027s Island! Fortress Monroe! What did it mean? What _could_ it\r\nmean? He searched and found plans, plans, plans of harbors, plans of\r\ncoast defenses, plans of ships building, plans of full naval and\r\nmilitary strength; everything, everything! He straightened. How his\r\nbreath pained him! ... And all this was the handiwork of the woman he\r\nloved! Good God, what was going on in this house? What right had such\r\nthings as these to be in a private home? For what purpose had they been\r\ndrawn? so accurately reproduced? For what purpose?\r\n\r\nOh, whatever the purpose was, _she_ was innocent; upon this conviction\r\nhe would willingly stake his soul. Innocent, innocent! ticked the clock\r\nover the mantel. Yes, she was innocent. Else, how could she laugh in\r\nthat light-hearted fashion? How could the song tremble on her lips? How\r\ncould her eyes shine so bright and merry?... Karloff, Annesley! Karloff\r\nthe Russian, Annesley the American; the one a secret agent of his\r\ncountry, the other a former trusted official! No, no! He could not\r\nentertain so base a thought against the father of the girl he loved.\r\nHad he not admired his clean record, his personal bravery, his fearless\r\nhonesty? And yet, that absent-mindedness, this care-worn countenance,\r\nthese must mean something. The purpose, to find out the purpose of\r\nthese plans!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"A Saint Bernard dog might have done as much.\"--ACT III]\r\n\r\nHe took the handkerchief and hid it in his breast, and quietly stole\r\naway.... A handkerchief, a rose, and a kiss; yes, that was all that\r\nwould ever be his.\r\n\r\nPirate nearly coughed his head off that night; but, it being William\u0027s\r\nnight off, nobody paid any particular attention to that justly\r\nindignant animal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nTHE ROSE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a Wednesday morning, clear and cold: not a cloud floated across the\r\nsky, nor did there rise above the horizon one of those clouds\r\n(portentous forerunners of evil!) to which novelists refer as being \"no\r\nlarger than a man\u0027s hand\". Heaven knew right well that the blight of\r\nevil was approaching fast enough, but there was no visible indication\r\non her face that glorious November morning. Doubtless you are familiar\r\nwith history and have read all about what great personages did just\r\nbefore calamity swooped down on them. The Trojans laughed at the wooden\r\nhorse; I don\u0027t know how many Roman banqueters never reached the desert\r\nbecause the enemy had not paid any singular regard to courtesies in\r\nmaking the attack; men and women danced on the eve of Waterloo--\"On\r\nwith the dance, let joy be unconfined\"; _my_ heroine simply went\r\nshopping. It doesn\u0027t sound at all romantic; very prosaic, in fact.\r\n\r\nShe declared her intention of making a tour of the shops and of\r\ndropping into Mrs. Chadwick\u0027s on the way home. She ordered James to\r\nbring around the pair and the coupe. James was an example of docile\r\nobedience. As she came down the steps, she was a thing of beauty and a\r\njoy for ever. She wore one of those jackets to which several\r\ngray-squirrel families had contributed their hides, a hat whose\r\nexistence was due to the negligence of a certain rare bird, and many\r\nsilk-worms had spun the fabric of her gown. Had any one called her\r\nattention to all this, there isn\u0027t any doubt that she would have been\r\nshocked. Only here and there are women who see what a true Moloch\r\nfashion is; this tender-souled girl saw only a handsome habit which\r\npleased the eye. Health bloomed in her cheeks, health shone from her\r\neyes, her step had all the elasticity of youth.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, James,\" she said pleasantly.\r\n\r\nJames touched his hat. What was it, he wondered. Somehow her eyes\r\nlooked unfamiliar to him. Had I been there I could have read the secret\r\neasily enough. Sometimes the pure pools of the forests are stirred and\r\nbecome impenetrable; but by and by the commotion subsides, and the\r\nwater clears. So it is with the human soul. There had been doubt\r\nhitherto in this girl\u0027s eyes; now, the doubt was gone.\r\n\r\nTo him, soberly watchful, her smile meant much; it was the patent of\r\nher innocence of any wrong thought. All night he had tossed on his cot,\r\nthinking, thinking! What should he do? What_ever_ should he do? That\r\nsome wrong was on the way he hadn\u0027t the least doubt. Should he confront\r\nthe colonel and demand an explanation, a demand he knew he had a\r\nperfect right to make? If this should be evil, and the shame of it fall\r\non this lovely being?... No, no! He must stand aside, he must turn a\r\ndeaf ear to duty, the voice of love spoke too loud. His own assurance\r\nof her innocence made him desire to fall at her feet and worship. After\r\nall, it _was_ none of his affair. Had he not played at this comedy,\r\nthis thing would have gone on, and he would have been in ignorance of\r\nits very existence. So, why should he meddle? Yet that monotonous query\r\nkept beating on his brain: What _was_ this thing?\r\n\r\nHe saw that he must wait. Yesterday he had feared nothing save his own\r\nexposure. Comedy had frolicked in her grinning mask. And here was\r\nTragedy stalking in upon the scene.\r\n\r\nThe girl named a dozen shops which she desired to honor with her custom\r\nand presence, and stepped into the coupe. William closed the door, and\r\nJames touched up the pair and drove off toward the city. He was\r\nperfectly indifferent to any possible exposure. In truth, he forgot\r\neverything, absolutely and positively everything, but the girl and the\r\nfortification plans she had been drawing.\r\n\r\nScarce a half a dozen bundles were the result of the tour among the\r\nshops.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Chadwick\u0027s, James.\"\r\n\r\nThe call lasted half an hour.\r\n\r\nAs a story-teller I am supposed to be everywhere, to follow the\r\nfootsteps of each and all of my characters, and with a fidelity and a\r\nperspicacity nothing short of the marvelous. So I take the liberty of\r\nimagining the pith of the conversation between the woman and the girl.\r\n\r\n_The Woman:_ How long, dear, have we known each other?\r\n\r\n_The Girl:_ Since I left school, I believe. Where _did_ you get that\r\nstunning morning gown?\r\n\r\n_The Woman_ (smiling in spite of the serious purpose she has in view):\r\nNever mind the gown, my child; I have something of greater importance\r\nto talk about.\r\n\r\n_The Girl: Is_ there anything more important to talk about among women?\r\n\r\n_The Woman:_ Yes. There is age.\r\n\r\n_The Girl:_ But, mercy, we do not talk about that!\r\n\r\n_The Woman:_ I am going to establish a precedent, then. I am forty, or\r\nat least, I am on the verge of it.\r\n\r\n_The Girl_ (warningly): Take care! If we should ever become enemies! If\r\nI should ever become treacherous!\r\n\r\n_The Woman:_ The world very well knows that I am older than I look.\r\nThat is why it takes such interest in my age.\r\n\r\n_The Girl:_ The question is, how _do_ you preserve it?\r\n\r\n_The Woman:_ Well, then, I am forty, while you stand on the threshold\r\nof the adorable golden twenties. (Walks over to picture taken eighteen\r\nyears before and contemplates it.) Ah, to be twenty again; to start\r\nanew, possessing my present learning and wisdom, and knowledge of the\r\nworld; to avoid the pits into which I so carelessly stumbled! But no!\r\n\r\n_The Girl_: Mercy! what have you to wish for? Are not princes and\r\nambassadors your friends; have you not health and wealth and beauty?\r\nYou wish for something, you who are so handsome and brilliant!\r\n\r\n_The Woman_: Blinds, my dear Betty, only blinds; for that is all beauty\r\nand wealth and wit are. Who sees behind sees scars of many wounds. You\r\nare without a mother, I am without a child. (Sits down beside the girl\r\nand takes her hand in hers.) Will you let me be a mother to you for\r\njust this morning? How can any man help loving you! (impulsively.)\r\n\r\n_The Girl_: How foolish you are, Grace!\r\n\r\n_The Woman_: Ah, to blush like that!\r\n\r\n_The Girl_: You are very embarrassing this morning. I believe you are\r\neven sentimental. Well, my handsome mother for just this morning, what\r\nis it you have to say to me? (jestingly.)\r\n\r\n_The Woman_: I do not know just how to begin. Listen. If ever trouble\r\nshould befall you, if ever misfortune should entangle you, will you\r\npromise to come to me?\r\n\r\n_The Girl:_ Misfortune? What is on your mind, Grace?\r\n\r\n_The Woman:_ Promise!\r\n\r\n_The Girl:_ I promise. (Laughs.)\r\n\r\n_The Woman:_ I am rich. Promise that if poverty should ever come to\r\nyou, you will come to me.\r\n\r\n_The Girl_ (puzzled): I do not understand you at all!\r\n\r\n_The Woman:_ Promise!\r\n\r\n_The Girl:_ I promise; but--\r\n\r\n_The Woman:_ Thank you, Betty.\r\n\r\n_The Girl_ (growing serious): What is all this about, Grace? You look\r\nso earnest.\r\n\r\n_The Woman:_ Some day you will understand. Will you answer me one\r\nquestion, as a daughter would answer her mother?\r\n\r\n_The Girl_ (gravely): Yes.\r\n\r\n_The Woman:_ Would you marry a title for the title\u0027s sake?\r\n\r\n_The Girl_ (indignantly): I?\r\n\r\n_The Woman:_ Yes; would you?\r\n\r\n_The Girl:_ I shall marry the man I love, and if not him, nobody. I\r\nmean, of course, _when_ I love.\r\n\r\n_The Woman:_ Blushing again? My dear, is Karloff anything to you?\r\n\r\n_The Girl:_ Karloff? Mercy, no. He is handsome and fascinating and\r\nrich, but I could not love him. It would be easier to love--to love my\r\ngroom outside.\r\n\r\n(They both smile.)\r\n\r\n_The Woman_ (grave once more): That is all I wished to know, dear.\r\nKarloff is not worthy of you.\r\n\r\n_The Girl_ (sitting very erect): I do not understand. Is he not\r\nhonorable?\r\n\r\n_The Woman_ (hesitating): I have known him for seven years; I have\r\nalways found him honorable.\r\n\r\n_The Girl:_ Why, then, should he not be worthy of me?\r\n\r\n_The Woman_ (lightly): Is any man?\r\n\r\n_The Girl:_ You are parrying my question. If I am to be your daughter,\r\nthere must be no fencing.\r\n\r\n_The Woman_ (rising and going over to the portrait again): There are\r\nsome things that a mother may not tell even to her daughter.\r\n\r\n_The Girl_ (determinedly): Grace, you have said too much or too little.\r\nI do not love Karloff, I never could love him; but I like him, and\r\nliking him, I feel called upon to defend him.\r\n\r\n_The Woman_ (surprised into showing her dismay): You defend him? You!\r\n\r\n_The Girl:_ And why not? That is what I wish to know: why not?\r\n\r\n_The Woman:_ My dear, you do not love him. That is all I wished to\r\nknow. Karloff is a brilliant, handsome man, a gentleman; his sense of\r\nhonor, such as it is, would do credit to many another man; but behind\r\nall this there is a power which makes him helpless, makes him a puppet,\r\nand robs him of certain worthy impulses. I have read somewhere that\r\ncorporations have no souls; neither have governments. Ask me nothing\r\nmore, Betty, for I shall answer no more questions.\r\n\r\n_The Girl:_ I do not think you are treating me fairly.\r\n\r\n_The Woman:_ At this moment I would willingly share with you half of\r\nall I possess in the world.\r\n\r\n_The Girl:_ But all this mystery!\r\n\r\n_The Woman:_ As I have said, some day you will understand. Treat\r\nKarloff as you have always treated him, politely and pleasantly. And I\r\nbeg of you never to repeat our conversation.\r\n\r\nThe Girl (to whom illumination suddenly comes; rises quickly and goes\r\nover to the woman; takes her by the shoulders, and the two stare into\r\neach other\u0027s eyes, the one searchingly, the other fearfully): Grace!\r\n\r\nThe Woman: I am a poor foolish woman, Betty, for all my worldliness and\r\nwisdom; but I love you (softly), and that is why I appear weak before\r\nyou. The blind envy those who see, the deaf those who hear; what one\r\ndoes not want another can not have. Karloff loves you, but you do not\r\nlove him.\r\n\r\n(The girl kisses the woman gravely on the cheek, and without a word,\r\nmakes her departure.)\r\n\r\nThe Woman (as she hears the carriage roll away): Poor girl! Poor,\r\nhappy, unconscious, motherless child! If only I had the power to stay\r\nthe blow! ... Who can it be, then, that she loves?\r\n\r\nThe Girl (in her carriage): Poor thing! She adores Karloff, and I never\r\nsuspected it! I shall begin to hate him.\r\n\r\nHow well women read each other!\r\n\r\nJames had never parted with his rose and his handkerchief. They were\r\nalways with him, no matter what livery he wore. After luncheon, William\r\nsaid that Miss Annesley desired to see him in the study. So James\r\nspruced up and duly presented himself at the study door.\r\n\r\n\"You sent for me, Miss?\"--his hat in his hand, his attitude deferential\r\nand attentive.\r\n\r\nShe was engaged upon some fancy work, the name of which no man knows,\r\nand if he were told, could not possibly remember for longer than ten\r\nminutes. She laid this on the reading-table, stood up and brushed the\r\nthreads from the little two-by-four cambric apron.\r\n\r\n\"James, on Monday night I dropped a rose on the lawn. (Finds thread on\r\nher sleeve.) In the morning when I looked for it (brushes the apron\r\nagain), it was gone. Did you find it?\" She made a little ball of the\r\nstraggling threads and dropped it into the waste-basket. A woman who\r\nhas the support of beauty can always force a man to lower his gaze.\r\nJames looked at his boots. His heart gave one great bound toward his\r\nthroat, then sank what seemed to be fathoms deep in his breast. This\r\nwas a thunderbolt out of heaven itself. Had she seen him, then? For a\r\nspace he was tempted to utter a falsehood; but there was that in her\r\neyes which warned him of the uselessness of such an expedient. Yet, to\r\ngive up that rose would be like giving up some part of his being. She\r\nrepeated the question: \"I ask you if you found it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Miss Annesley.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you still possess it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Miss.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why did you pick it up?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was fresh and beautiful; and I believed that some lady at the\r\ndinner had worn it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so you picked it up? Where did you find it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Outside the bow-window, Miss.\"\r\n\r\n\"When?\"\r\n\r\nHe thought for a moment. \"In the morning, Miss.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take care, James; it was not yet eleven o\u0027clock, at night.\"\r\n\r\n\"I admit what I said was not true, Miss. As you say, it was not yet\r\neleven.\" James was pale. So she had thrown it away, confident that this\r\nmoment would arrive. This humiliation was premeditated. Patience, he\r\nsaid inwardly; this would be the last opportunity she should have to\r\nhumiliate him.\r\n\r\n\"Have you the flower on your person?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Miss.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you know that it was mine?\"\r\n\r\nHe was silent.\r\n\r\n\"Did you know that it was mine?\"--mercilessly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but I believed that you had deliberately thrown it away. I saw no\r\nharm in taking it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there _was harm.\"_\r\n\r\n\"I bow to your superior judgment, Miss,\"--ironically.\r\n\r\nShe deemed it wisest to pass over this experimental irony. \"Give the\r\nflower back to me. It is not proper that a servant should have in his\r\nkeeping a rose which was once mine, even if I had thrown it away or\r\ndiscarded it.\"\r\n\r\nCarefully he drew forth the crumpled flower. He looked at her, then at\r\nthe rose, hoping against hope that she might relent. He hesitated till\r\nhe saw an impatient movement of the extended hand. He surrendered.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. That is all. You may go.\"\r\n\r\nShe tossed the withered flower into the waste-basket.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, but before I go I have to announce that I shall resign my\r\nposition next Monday. The money which has been advanced to me,\r\ndeducting that which is due me, together with the amount of my fine at\r\nthe police-court, I shall be pleased to return to you on the morning of\r\nmy departure.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Annesley\u0027s lips fell apart, and her brows arched. She was very\r\nmuch surprised.\r\n\r\n\"You wish to leave my service?\"--as if it were quite impossible that\r\nsuch a thing should occur to him.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Miss.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are dissatisfied with your position?\"--icily.\r\n\r\n\"It is not that, Miss. As a groom I am perfectly satisfied. The trouble\r\nlies in the fact that I have too many other things to do. It is very\r\ndistasteful for me to act in the capacity of butler. My temper is not\r\nequable enough for that position.\" He bowed.\r\n\r\n\"Very well. I trust that you will not regret your decision.\" She sat\r\ndown and coolly resumed her work.\r\n\r\n\"It is not possible that I shall regret it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may go.\"\r\n\r\nHe bowed again, one corner of his mouth twisted. Then he took himself\r\noff to the stables. He was certainly in what they call a towering rage.\r\n\r\nIf I were not a seer of the first degree, a narrator of the penetrative\r\norder, I should be vastly puzzled over this singular action on her part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nTHE DRAMA UNROLLS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a dramatist submits his _scenario_, he always accompanies it with\r\ndrawings, crude or otherwise, of the various set-scenes and curtains\r\nknown as drops. To the uninitiated these scrawls would look impossible;\r\nbut to the stage-manager\u0027s keen, imaginative eye a whole picture is\r\nrepresented in these few pothooks. Each object on the stage is labeled\r\nalphabetically; thus A may represent a sofa, B a window, C a table, and\r\nso forth and so on. I am not a dramatist; I am not writing an acting\r\ndrama; so I find that a diagram of the library in Senator Blank\u0027s house\r\nis neither imperative nor advisable. It is half after eight; the\r\ncurtain rises; the music of a violin is heard coming from the\r\nmusic-room; Colonel Annesley is discovered sitting in front of the wood\r\nfire, his chin sunk on his breast, his hands hanging listlessly on each\r\nside of the chair, his face deeply lined. From time to time he looks at\r\nthe clock. I can imagine no sorrier picture than that of this loving,\r\ntender-hearted, wretched old man as he sits there, waiting for Karloff\r\nand the ignominious end. Fortune gone with the winds, poverty leering\r\ninto his face, shame drawing her red finder across his brow, honor in\r\nsackcloth and ashes!\r\n\r\nAnd but two short years ago there had not been in all the wide land a\r\nmore contented man than himself, a man with a conscience freer. God!\r\nEven yet he could hear the rolling, whirring ivory ball as it spun the\r\ncircle that fatal night at Monte Carlo. Man does not recall the\r\nintermediate steps of his fall, only the first step and the last. In\r\nhis waking hours the colonel always heard the sound of it, and it\r\nrattled through his troubled dreams. He could not understand how\r\neverything had gone as it had. It seemed impossible that in two years\r\nhe had dissipated a fortune, sullied his honor, beggared his child. It\r\nwas all so like a horrible dream. If only he might wake; if only God\r\nwould be so merciful as to permit him to wake! He hid his face. There\r\nis no hell save conscience makes it.\r\n\r\nThe music laughed and sighed and laughed. It was the music of love and\r\nyouth; joyous, rollicking, pulsing music.\r\n\r\nThe colonel sprang to his feet suddenly, his hands at his throat. He\r\nwas suffocating. The veins gnarled on his neck and brow. There was in\r\nhis heart a pain as of many knives. His arms fell: of what use was it\r\nto struggle? He was caught, trapped in a net of his own contriving.\r\n\r\nSoftly he crossed the room and stood by the portiere beyond which was\r\nthe music-room. She was happy, happy in her youth and ignorance; she\r\ncould play all those sprightly measures, her spirit as light and\r\nconscience-free; she could sing, she could laugh, she could dance. And\r\nall the while his heart was breaking, breaking!\r\n\r\n\"How shall I face her mother?\" he groaned.\r\n\r\nThe longing which always seizes the guilty to confess and relieve the\r\nmind came over him. If only he dared rush in there, throw himself at\r\nher feet, and stammer forth his wretched tale! She was of his flesh, of\r\nhis blood; when she knew she would not wholly condemn him . . . No, no!\r\nHe could not. She honored and trusted him now; she had placed him on so\r\nhigh a pedestal that it was utterly impossible for him to disillusion\r\nher young mind, to see for ever and ever the mute reproach in her\r\nhonest eyes, to feel that though his arm encircled her she was beyond\r\nhis reach.... God knew that he could not tell this child of the black\r\ngulf he had digged for himself and her.\r\n\r\nSometimes there came to him the thought to put an end to this maddening\r\ngrief, by violence to period this miserable existence. But always he\r\ncast from him the horrible thought. He was not a coward, and the\r\ncowardice of suicide was abhorrent to him. Poverty he might leave her,\r\nbut not the legacy of a suicide. If only it might be God\u0027s kindly will\r\nto let him die, once this abominable bargain was consummated! Death is\r\nthe seal of silence; it locks alike the lips of the living and the\r\ndead. And she might live in ignorance, till the end of her days,\r\nwithout knowing that her wealth was the price of her father\u0027s dishonor.\r\n\r\nA mist blurred his sight; he could not see. He steadied himself, and\r\nwith an effort regained his chair noiselessly. And how often he had\r\nsmiled at the drama on the stage, with its absurdities, its tawdriness,\r\nits impossibilities! Alas, what did they on the stage that was half so\r\nweak as he had done: ruined himself without motive or reason!\r\n\r\nThe bell sang its buzzing note; there was the sound of crunching wheels\r\non the driveway; the music ceased abruptly. Silence. A door opened and\r\nclosed. A moment or so later Karloff, preceded by the girl, came into\r\nthe study. She was grave because she remembered Mrs. Chadwick. He was\r\ngrave also; he had various reasons for being so.\r\n\r\n\"Father, the count tells me that he has an engagement with you,\" she\r\nsaid. She wondered if this appointment in any way concerned her.\r\n\r\n\"It is true, my child. Leave us, and give orders that we are not to be\r\ndisturbed.\"\r\n\r\nShe scrutinized him sharply. How strangely hollow his voice sounded!\r\nWas he ill?\r\n\r\n\"Father, you are not well. Count, you must promise me not to keep him\r\nlong, however important this interview may be. He is ill and needs\r\nrest,\"--and her loving eyes caressed each line of care in her parent\u0027s\r\nfurrowed cheeks.\r\n\r\nAnnesley smiled reassuringly. It took all the strength of his will, all\r\nthat remained of a high order of courage, to create this smile. He\r\nwanted to cry out to her that it was a lie, a mockery. Behind that\r\nsmile his teeth grated.\r\n\r\n\"I shall not keep him long, Mademoiselle,\" said the count. He spoke\r\ngently, but he studiously avoided her eyes.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated for a moment on the threshold; she knew not why. Her lips\r\neven formed words, but she did not speak. What was it? Something\r\noppressed her. Her gaze wandered indecisively from her father to the\r\ncount, from the count to her father.\r\n\r\n\"When you are through,\" she finally said, \"bring your cigars into the\r\nmusic-room.\"\r\n\r\n\"With the greatest pleasure, Mademoiselle,\" replied the count. \"And\r\nplay, if you so desire; our business is such that your music will be as\r\na pleasure added.\u0027\"\r\n\r\nHer father nodded; but he could not force another smile to his lips.\r\nThe brass rings of the portiere rattled, and she was gone. But she left\r\nbehind a peculiar tableau, a tableau such as is formed by those who\r\nstand upon ice which is about to sink and engulf them.\r\n\r\nThe two men stood perfectly still. I doubt not that each experienced\r\nthe same sensation, that the same thought occurred to each mind, though\r\nit came from different avenues: love and shame. The heart of the little\r\nclock on the mantel beat tick-tock, tick-tock; a log crackled and fell\r\nbetween the irons, sending up a shower of evanescent sparks; one of the\r\nlong windows giving out upon the veranda creaked mysteriously.\r\n\r\nKarloff was first to break the spell. He made a gesture which was\r\neloquent of his distaste of the situation.\r\n\r\n\"Let us terminate this as quickly as possible,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, let us have done with it before I lose my courage,\" replied the\r\ncolonel, his voice thin and quavering. He wiped his forehead with his\r\nhandkerchief. His hand shone white and his nails darkly blue.\r\n\r\nThe count stepped over to the table, reached into the inner pocket of\r\nhis coat, and extracted a packet. In this packet was the enormous sum\r\nof one hundred and eighty thousand dollars in notes of one thousand\r\ndenomination; that is to say, one hundred and eighty slips of paper\r\nredeemable in gold by the government which had issued them. On top of\r\nthis packet lay the colonel\u0027s note for twenty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n(It is true that Karloff never accepted money from his government in\r\npayment for his services; but it is equally true that for every penny\r\nhe laid out he was reimbursed by Russia.)\r\n\r\nKarloff placed the packet on the table, first taking off the note,\r\nwhich he carelessly tossed beside the bank-notes.\r\n\r\n\"You will observe that I have not bothered with having your note\r\ndiscounted. I have fulfilled my part of the bargain; fulfil yours.\" The\r\ncount thrust his trembling hands into his trousers pockets. He desired\r\nto hide this embarrassing sign from his accomplice.\r\n\r\nAnnesley went to a small safe which stood at the left of the fireplace\r\nand returned with a packet somewhat bulkier than the count\u0027s. He\r\ndropped it beside the money, shudderingly, as though he had touched a\r\npoisonous viper.\r\n\r\n\"My honor,\" he said simply. \"I had never expected to sell it so cheap.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, during which neither man\u0027s gaze swerved from the\r\nother\u0027s. There was not the slightest, not even the remotest, fear of\r\ntreachery; each man knew with whom he was dealing; yet there they\r\nstood, as if fascinated. One would have thought that the colonel would\r\nhave counted his money, or Karloff his plans; they did neither. Perhaps\r\nthe colonel wanted Karloff to touch the plans first, before he touched\r\nthe money; perhaps Karloff had the same desire, only the other way\r\naround.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I am simply Miss Annesly\u0027s servant.\"--ACT III.]\r\n\r\nThe colonel spoke.\r\n\r\n\"I believe that is all\" he said quietly. The knowledge that the deed\r\nwas done and that there was no retreat gave back to him a particle of\r\nhis former coolness and strength of mind. It had been the thought of\r\ncommitting the crime that had unnerved him. Now that his bridges were\r\nburned, a strange, unnatural calm settled on him.\r\n\r\nThe count evidently was not done. He moistened his lips. There was a\r\ndryness in his throat.\r\n\r\n\"It is not too late\" he said; \"I have not yet touched them.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall not indulge in moralizing, if you please,\" interrupted the\r\ncolonel, with savage irony. \"The moment for that has gone by.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well.\" Karloff\u0027s shoulders settled; his jaws became aggressively\r\nangular; some spirit of his predatory forebears touched his face here\r\nand there, hardening it. \"I wish to speak in regard to your daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough! Take my honor and be gone!\" The colonel\u0027s voice was loud and\r\nrasping.\r\n\r\nKarloff rested his hands on the table and inclined his body toward the\r\ncolonel.\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me,\" he began. \"There is in every man the making and the\r\ncapacity of a great rascal. Time and opportunity alone are needed--and\r\na motive. The other night I told you that I could not give up your\r\ndaughter. Well, I have not given her up. She must be my wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Must?\" The colonel clenched his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Must. To-night I am going to prove myself a great rascal--with a great\r\nmotive. What is Russia to me? Nothing. What is your dishonor or my own?\r\nLess than nothing. There is only one thing, and that is my love for\r\nyour daughter.\" He struck the table and the flame of the student-lamp\r\nrose violently. \"She must be mine, mine! I have tried to win her as an\r\nhonorable man tries to win the woman he loves; now she must be won by\r\nan act of rascality. Heaven nor hell shall force me to give her up.\r\nYes, I love her; and I lower myself to your level to gain her.\"\r\n\r\n\"To my level! Take care; I am still a man, with a man\u0027s strength,\"\r\ncried the colonel.\r\n\r\nKarloff swept his hand across his forehead. \"I have lied to myself long\r\nenough, and to you. I can see now that I have been working solely\r\ntoward one end. My country is not to be considered, neither is yours.\r\nDo you realize that you stand wholly and completely in my power?\" He\r\nran his tongue across his lips, which burned with fever.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"--hoarsely.\r\n\r\n\"I mean, your daughter must become my wife, or I shall notify your\r\ngovernment that you have attempted to betray it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You dishonorable wretch!\" The colonel balled his fists and protruded\r\nhis nether lip. Only the table stood between them.\r\n\r\n\"That term or another, it does not matter. The fact remains that you\r\nhave sold to me the fortification plans of your country; and though it\r\nbe in times of peace, you are none the less guilty and culpable. Your\r\ndaughter shall be my wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had rather strangle her with these hands!\"--passionately.\r\n\r\n\"Well, why should I not have her for my wife? Who loves her more than\r\nI? I am rich; from hour to hour, from day to day, what shall I not plan\r\nto make her happy? I love her with all the fire and violence of my race\r\nand blood. I can not help it. I will not, can not, live without her!\r\nGood God, yes! I recognize the villainy of my actions. But I am mad\r\nto-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I perceive.\" The colonel gazed wildly about the walls for a weapon.\r\nThere was not even the usual ornamental dagger.\r\n\r\nA window again stirred mysteriously. A few drops of rain plashed on the\r\nglass and zigzagged down to the sash.\r\n\r\n\"Sooner or later your daughter must know. Request her presence. It\r\nrests with her, not with you, as to what course I must follow.\" Karloff\r\nwas extraordinarily pale, and his dark eyes, reflecting the dancing\r\nflames, sparkled like rubies.\r\n\r\nHe saw the birth of horror in the elder\u0027s eyes, saw it grow and grow.\r\nHe saw the colonel\u0027s lips move spasmodically, but utter no sound. What\r\nwas it he saw over his (the count\u0027s) shoulders and beyond?\r\nInstinctively he turned, and what he saw chilled the heat of his blood.\r\n\r\nThere stood the girl, her white dress marble-white against the dark\r\nwine of the portiere, an edge of which one hand clutched convulsively.\r\nWas it Medusa\u0027s beauty or her magic that turned men into stone? My\r\nrecollection is at fault. At any rate, so long as she remained\r\nmotionless, neither man had the power to stir. She held herself\r\nperfectly erect; every fiber in her young body was tense. Her beauty\r\nbecame weirdly powerful, masked as it was with horror, doubt, shame,\r\nand reproach. She had heard; little or much was of no consequence. In\r\nthe heat of their variant passions, the men\u0027s voices had risen to a\r\npitch that penetrated beyond the room.\r\n\r\nKarloff was first to recover, and he took an involuntary step toward\r\nher; but she waved him back disdainfully.\r\n\r\n\"Do not come near me. I loathe you!\" The voice was low, but every note\r\nwas strained and unmusical.\r\n\r\nHe winced. His face could not have stung or burned more hotly had she\r\nstruck him with her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Mademoiselle!\"\r\n\r\nShe ignored him. \"Father, what does this mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Agony!\" The colonel fell back into his chair, pressing his hands over\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you what it means!\" cried Karloff, a rage possessing him.\r\nHe had made a mistake. He had misjudged both the father and the child.\r\nHe could force her into his arms, but he would always carry a burden of\r\nhate. \"It means that this night you stand in the presence of a\r\ndishonored parent, a man who has squandered your inheritance over\r\ngambling tables, and who, to recover these misused sums, has sold to me\r\nthe principal fortification plans of his country. That is what is\r\nmeans, Mademoiselle.\"\r\n\r\nShe grasped the portiere for support.\r\n\r\n\"Father, is this thing true?\" Her voice fell to a terror-stricken\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it is true enough,\" said Karloff. \"God knows that it is true\r\nenough. But it rests with you to save him. Become my wife, and yonder\r\nfire shall swallow his dishonor--and mine. Refuse, and I shall expose\r\nhim. After all, love is a primitive state, and with it we go back to\r\nthe beginning; before it honor or dishonor is nothing. To-night there\r\nis nothing, nothing in the world save my love for you, and the chance\r\nthat has given me the power to force you to be mine. What a fury and a\r\ntempest love produces! It makes an honorable man of the knave, a rascal\r\nof the man of honor; it has toppled thrones, destroyed nations,\r\nobliterated races. ... Well, I have become a rascal. Mademoiselle, you\r\nmust become my wife.\" He lifted his handsome head resolutely.\r\n\r\nWithout giving him so much as a glance, she swept past him and sank on\r\nher knees at her father\u0027s side, taking his hands by the wrists and\r\npressing them down from his face.\r\n\r\n\"Father, tell him he lies! Tell him he lies!\" Ah, the entreaty, the\r\nlove, the anxiety, the terror that blended her tones!\r\n\r\nHe strove to look away.\r\n\r\n\"Father, you are all I have,\" she cried brokenly. \"Look at me! Look at\r\nme and tell him that he lies!... You will not look at me? God have\r\nmercy on me, it is true, then!\" She rose and spread her arms toward\r\nheaven to entreat God to witness her despair. \"I did not think or know\r\nthat such base things were done... That these loving hands should have\r\nhelped to encompass my father\u0027s dishonor, his degradation! ... For\r\nmoney! What is money? You knew, father, that what was mine was likewise\r\nyours. Why did you not tell me? I should have laughed; we should have\r\nbegun all over again; I could have earned a living with my music; we\r\nshould have been honest and happy. And now!... And I drew those plans\r\nwith a heart full of love and happiness! Oh, it is not that you\r\ngambled, that you have foolishly wasted a fortune; it is not these that\r\nhurt here,\"--pressing her heart. \"It is the knowledge that you, my\r\nfather, should let _me_ draw those horrible things. It hurts! Ah, how\r\nit hurts!\" A sob choked her. She knelt again at her parent\u0027s side and\r\nflung her arms around the unhappy, wretched man. \"Father, you have\r\ncommitted a crime to shield a foolish act. I know, I know! What you\r\nhave done you did for my sake, to give me back what you thought was my\r\nown. Oh, how well I know that you had no thought of yourself; it was\r\nall for me, and I thank God for that. But something has died here,\r\nsomething here in my heart. I have been so happy! ... too happy! My\r\npoor father!\" She laid her head against his breast.\r\n\r\n\"My heart is broken! Would to God that I might die!\" Annesley threw one\r\narm across the back of the chair and turned his face to his sleeve.\r\n\r\nKarloff, a thousand arrows of regret and shame and pity quivering in\r\nhis heart, viewed the scene moodily, doggedly. No, he could not go\r\nback; there was indeed a wall behind him: pride.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mademoiselle?\"\r\n\r\nShe turned, still on her knees.\r\n\r\n\"You say that if I do not marry you, you will ruin my father, expose\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\"--thinly.\r\n\r\n\"Listen. I am a proud woman, yet will I beg you not to do this horrible\r\nthing--force me into your arms. Take everything, take all that is left;\r\nyou can not be so utterly base as to threaten such a wrong.\r\nSee!\"--extending her lovely arms, \"I am on my knees to you!\"\r\n\r\n\"My daughter!\" cried the father.\r\n\r\n\"Do not interrupt me, father; he will relent; he is not wholly without\r\npity.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no! No, no!\" Karloff exclaimed, turning his head aside and\r\nrepelling with his hands, as if he would stamp out the fires of pity\r\nwhich, at the sound of her voice, had burst anew in his heart. \"I\r\n_will_ not give you up!\"\r\n\r\nShe drew her sleeve across her eyes and stood up. All at once she\r\nwheeled upon him like a lioness protecting its young. In her wrath she\r\nwas as magnificent as the wife of--Aeneas at the funeral pyre of that\r\ngreat captain.\r\n\r\n\"She knew! That was why she asked me all those questions; that is why\r\nshe exacted those promises! Mrs. Chadwick knew and dared not tell me!\r\nAnd I trusted you as a friend, as a gentleman, as a man of honor!\" Her\r\nlaughter rang out wildly. \"And for these favors you bring dishonor!\r\nShame! Shame! Your wife? Have you thought well of what you are about to\r\ndo?\"\r\n\r\n\"So well,\" he declared, \"that I shall proceed to the end, to the very\r\nend.\" How beautiful she was! And a mad desire urged him to spring to\r\nher, crush her in his arms, and force upon her lips a thousand mad\r\nkisses!\r\n\r\n\"Have you weighed well the consequences?\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon love\u0027s most delicate scales.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you calculated what manner of woman I am?\"--with subdued\r\nfierceness.\r\n\r\n\"To me you are the woman of all women.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think that I am a faint-hearted girl? You are making a mistake.\r\nI am a woman with a woman\u0027s mind, and a thousand years would not alter\r\nmy utter contempt of you. Force me to marry you, and as there is a God\r\nabove us to witness, every moment of suffering you now inflict upon me\r\nand mine, I shall give back a day, a long, bitter, galling day. Do you\r\nthink that it will be wise to call me countess?\" Her scorn was superb.\r\n\r\n\"I am waiting for your answer. Will you be my wife, or shall I be\r\nforced to make my villainy definitive?\"\r\n\r\n\"Permit me to take upon these shoulders the burden of answering that\r\nquestion,\" said a voice from the window.\r\n\r\nWarburton, dressed in his stable clothes and leggings, hatless and\r\ndrenched with rain, stepped into the room from the veranda and quickly\r\ncrossed the intervening space. Before any one of the tragic group could\r\nrecover from the surprise caused by his unexpected appearance, he had\r\npicked up the packet of plans and had dropped it into the fire. Then he\r\nleaned with his back against the mantel and faced them, or rather\r\nKarloff, of whom he was not quite sure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nSOMETHING ABOUT HEROES\r\n\r\n\r\nTick-lock, tick-tock went the voice of the little friend of eternity on\r\nthe mantel-piece; the waxen sheets (to which so much care and labor had\r\nbeen given) writhed and unfolded, curled and crackled, and blackened on\r\nthe logs; the cold wind and rain blew in through the opened window; the\r\nlamp flared and flickered inside its green shade; a legion of heroes\r\npeered out from the book-cases, no doubt much astonished at the sight\r\nof this ordinary hero of mine and his mean, ordinary clothes. I have in\r\nmy mind\u0027s eye the picture of good D\u0027Artagnan\u0027s frank contempt, Athos\u0027\r\nmagnificent disdain, the righteous (I had almost said honest!) horror\r\nof the ultra-fashionable Aramis, and the supercilious indignation of\r\nthe bourgeois Porthos. What! this a hero? Where, then, was his rapier,\r\nhis glittering baldric, his laces, his dancing plumes, his fine air?\r\n\r\nSeveral times in the course of this narrative I have expressed my\r\nregret in not being an active witness of this or that scene, a regret\r\nwhich, as I am drawing most of these pictures from hearsay, is\r\nperfectly natural. What must have been the varying expressions on each\r\nface! Warburton, who, though there was tumult in his breast, coolly\r\nwaited for Karloff to make the next move; Annesley, who saw his\r\nterrible secret in the possession of a man whom he supposed to be a\r\nstable-man; Karloff, who saw his house of cards vanish in the dartling\r\ntongues of flame, and recognized the futility of his villainy; the\r\ngirl... Ah, who shall describe the dozen shadowy emotions which crossed\r\nand recrossed her face?\r\n\r\nFrom Warburton\u0027s dramatic entrance upon the scene to Karloff\u0027s first\r\nmovement, scarce a minute had passed, though to the girl and her father\r\nan eternity seemed to come and go. Karloff was a brave man. Upon the\r\ninstant of his recovery, he sprang toward Warburton, silently and with\r\npredetermination: he must regain some fragment of those plans. He would\r\nnot, could not, suffer total defeat before this girl\u0027s eyes; his blood\r\nrebelled against the thought. He expected the groom to strike him, but\r\nJames simply caught him by the arms and thrust him back.\r\n\r\n\"No, Count; no, no; they shall burn to the veriest crisp!\"\r\n\r\n\"Stand aside, lackey!\" cried Karloff, a sob of rage strangling him.\r\nAgain he rushed upon Warburton, his clenched hand uplifted. Warburton\r\ndid not even raise his hands this time. So they stood, their faces\r\nwithin a hand\u0027s span of each other, the one smiling coldly, the other\r\nin the attitude of striking a blow. Karloff\u0027s hand fell unexpectedly,\r\nbut not on the man in front of him. \"Good God, no! a gentleman does not\r\nstrike a lackey! Stand aside, stand aside!\"\r\n\r\n\"They shall burn, Count,\"--quietly; \"they shall burn, because I am\r\nphysically the stronger.\" Warburton turned quickly and with the toe of\r\nhis boot shifted the glowing packet and renewed the flames. \"I never\r\nrealized till to-night that I loved my country half so well. Lackey?\r\nYes, for the present.\"\r\n\r\nHe had not yet looked at the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" Karloff cried, intelligence lighting his face. \"You are no\r\nlackey!\"--subduing his voice.\r\n\r\nJames smiled. \"You are quite remarkable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you? I demand to know!\"\r\n\r\n\"First and foremost, I am a citizen of the United States; I have been a\r\nsoldier besides. It was my common right to destroy these plans, which\r\nindirectly menaced my country\u0027s safety. These,\"--pointing to the\r\nbank-notes, \"are yours, I believe. Nothing further requires your\r\npresence here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes; I remember now! Fool that I have been!\" Karloff struck his\r\nforehead in helpless rage. \"I never observed you closely till now. I\r\nrecall. The secret service: Europe, New York, Washington; you have\r\nknown it all along. Spy!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is an epithet which easily rebounds. Spy? Why, yes; I do for my\r\ncountry what you do for yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"The name, the name! I can not recollect the name! The beard is gone,\r\nbut that does not matter,\"--excitedly.\r\n\r\nWarburton breathed easier. While he did not want the girl to know who\r\nhe was just then, he was glad that Karloffs memory had taken his\r\nthought away from the grate and its valuable but rapidly disappearing\r\nfuel.\r\n\r\n\"Father! Father, what is it?\" cried the girl, her voice keyed to agony.\r\n\"Father!\"\r\n\r\nThe two men turned about. Annesley had fainted in his chair. Both\r\nWarburton and Karloff mechanically started forward to offer aid, but\r\nshe repelled their approach.\r\n\r\n\"Do not come near me; you have done enough. Father, dear!\" She slapped\r\nthe colonel\u0027s wrists and unloosed his collar.\r\n\r\nThe antagonists, forgetting their own battle, stood silently watching\r\nhers. Warburton\u0027s mind was first to clear, and without a moment\u0027s\r\nhesitation he darted from the room and immediately returned with a\r\nglass of water. He held it out to the girl. Their glances clashed; a\r\nthousand mute, angry questions in her eyes, a thousand mute, humble\r\nanswers in his. She accepted the glass, and her hand trembled as she\r\ndipped her fingers into the cool depths and flecked the drops into the\r\nunconscious man\u0027s face.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Karloff stood with folded arms, staring melancholically into\r\nthe grate, where his dreams had disappeared in smoke. By and by the\r\ncolonel sighed and opened his eyes. For a time he did not know where he\r\nwas, and his gaze wandered mistily from face to face. Then recollection\r\ncame back to him, recollection bristling with thorns. He struggled to\r\nhis feet and faced Warburton. The girl put her arms around him to\r\nsteady him, but he gently disengaged himself.\r\n\r\n\"Are you from the secret service, sir? If so, I am ready to accompany\r\nyou wherever you say. I, who have left my blood on many a battleground,\r\nwas about to commit a treasonable act. Allow me first to straighten up\r\nmy affairs, then you may do with me as you please. I am guilty of a\r\ncrime; I have the courage to pay the penalty.\" His calm was\r\nextraordinary, and even Karloff looked at him with a sparkle of\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nAs a plummet plunges into the sea, so the girl\u0027s look plunged into\r\nWarburton\u0027s soul; and had he been an officer of the law, he knew that\r\nhe would have utterly disregarded his duty.\r\n\r\n\"I am not a secret service man, sir,\" he replied unevenly. \"If I\r\nwere,\"--pointing to the grate, \"your plans would not have fed the fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you, then, and what do you in my house in this\r\nguise?\"--proudly.\r\n\r\n\"I am your head stable-man--for the present. It was all by chance. I\r\ncame into this room yesterday to get a book on veterinary surgery. I\r\naccidentally saw a plan. I have been a soldier. I knew that such a\r\nthing had no rightful place in this house.... I was coming across the\r\nlawn, when I looked into the window. ... It is not for me to judge you,\r\nsir. My duty lay in destroying those plans before they harmed any one.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it is not for you to judge me,\" said the colonel. \"I have gambled\r\naway my daughter\u0027s fortune. To keep her in ignorance of the fact and to\r\nreturn to her the amount I had wrongfully used, I consented to sell to\r\nRussia the coast fortification plans of my country, such as I could\r\ndraw from memory. No, it is not for you to judge me; only God has the\r\nright to do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am only a groom,\" said Warburton, simply. \"What I have heard I shall\r\nforget.\"\r\n\r\nAh, had he but looked at the girl\u0027s face then!\r\n\r\nA change came over Karloff\u0027s countenance; his shoulders drooped; the\r\nmelancholy fire died out of his face and eyes. With an air of\r\nresignation and a clear sense of the proportion of things, he reached\r\nout and took up the note upon which Annesley had scrawled his signature.\r\n\r\nWarburton, always alert, seized the count\u0027s wrist. He saw the name of a\r\nbank and the sum of five figures.\r\n\r\n\"What is this?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"It is mine,\" replied the count, haughtily.\r\n\r\nWarburton released him.\r\n\r\n\"He speaks truly,\" said the colonel. \"It is his.\"\r\n\r\n\"The hour of madness is past,\" the Russian began, slowly and musically.\r\nThe tone was musing. He seemed oblivious of his surroundings and that\r\nthree pairs of curious eyes were leveled in his direction. He studied\r\nthe note, creased it, drew it through his fingers, smoothed it and\r\ncaressed it. \"And I should have done exactly as I threatened. There is,\r\nthen, a Providence which watches jealously over the innocent? And I was\r\na skeptic!... Two hundred thousand dollars,\"--picking up the packet of\r\nbanknotes and balancing it on his hand. \"Well, it is a sum large enough\r\nto tempt any man. How the plans and schemes of men crumble to the\r\ntouch! Ambition is but the pursuit of mirages.... Mademoiselle, you\r\nwill never know what the ignominy of this moment has cost me--nor how\r\nwell I love you. I come of a race of men who pursue their heart\u0027s\r\ndesire through fire and water. Obstacles are nothing; the end is\r\neverything. In Europe I should have won, in honor or in dishonor. But\r\nthis American people, I do not quite understand them; and that is why I\r\nhave played the villain to no purpose.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, and a sad, bitter smile played over his face.\r\n\r\n\"Mademoiselle,\" he continued, \"henceforth, wherever I may go, your face\r\nand the sound of your voice shall abide with me. I do not ask you to\r\nforget, but I ask you to forgive.\" Again he paused.\r\n\r\nShe uttered no sound.\r\n\r\n\"Well, one does not forget nor forgive these things in so short a time.\r\nAnd, after all, it was your own father\u0027s folly. Fate threw him across\r\nmy path at a critical moment--but I had reckoned without you. Your\r\nfather is a brave man, for he had the courage to offer himself to the\r\nlaw; I have the courage to give you up. I, too, am a soldier; I\r\nrecognize the value of retreat.\" To Warburton he said: \"A groom, a\r\nhostler, to upset such plans as these! I do not know who you are, sir,\r\nnor how to account for your timely and peculiar appearance. But I fully\r\nrecognize the falseness of your presence here. Eh, well, this is what\r\ncomes of race prejudice, the senseless battle which has always been and\r\nalways will be waged between the noble and the peasant. Had I observed\r\nyou at the proper time, our positions might relatively have been\r\nchanged. Useless retrospection!\" To Annesley: \"Sir, we are equally\r\nculpable. Here is this note of yours. I might, as a small contribution\r\ntoward righting the comparative wrong which I have done you, I might\r\ncast it into the fire. But between gentlemen, situated as we are, the\r\nact would be as useless as it would be impossible. I might destroy the\r\nnote, but you would refuse to accept such generosity at my\r\nhands,--which is well.\"\r\n\r\n\"What you say is perfectly true.\" The colonel drew his daughter closer\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" went on the count, putting the note in his pocket, \"to-morrow I\r\nshall have my ducats.\"\r\n\r\n\"My bank will discount the note,\" said the colonel, with a proud look;\r\n\"my indebtedness shall be paid in full.\"\r\n\r\n\"As I have not the slightest doubt. Mademoiselle, fortune ignores you\r\nbut temporarily; misfortune has brushed only the hem of your garment,\r\nas it were. Do not let the fear of poverty alarm you,\"--lightly. \"I\r\nprophesy a great public future for you. And when you play that _Largo_\r\nof Handel\u0027s, to a breathless audience, who knows that I may not be\r\nhidden behind the curtain of some stall, drinking in the heavenly sound\r\nmade by that loving bow?.... Romance enters every human being\u0027s life;\r\nlike love and hate, it is primitive. But to every book fate writes\r\n_finis_.\"\r\n\r\nHe thrust the bank-notes carelessly into his coat pocket, and walked\r\nslowly toward the hallway. At the threshold he stopped and looked back.\r\nThe girl could not resist the magnetism of his dark eyes. She was\r\nmomentarily fascinated, and her heart beat painfully.\r\n\r\n\"If only I might go with the memory of your forgiveness,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I forgive you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you.\" Then Karloff resolutely proceeded; the portiere fell\r\nbehind him. Shortly after she heard the sound of closing doors, the\r\nrattle of a carriage, and then all became still. Thus the handsome\r\nbarbarian passed from the scene.\r\n\r\nThe colonel resumed his chair, his arm propped on a knee and his head\r\nbowed in his hand. Quickly the girl fell to her knees, hid her face on\r\nhis breast, and regardless of the groom\u0027s presence, silently wept.\r\n\r\n\"My poor child!\" faltered the colonel. \"God could not have intended to\r\ngive you so wretched a father. Poverty and dishonor, poverty and\r\ndishonor; I who love you so well have brought you these!\"\r\n\r\nWarburton, biting his trembling lips, tiptoed cautiously to the window,\r\nopened it and stepped outside. He raised his fevered face gratefully to\r\nthe icy rain. A great and noble plan had come to him.\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Chadwick said, love is magnificent only when it gives all\r\nwithout question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\nA FINE LOVER\r\n\r\n\r\nKarloff remained in seclusion till the following Tuesday; after that\r\nday he was seen no more in Washington. From time to time some news of\r\nhim filters through the diplomatic circles of half a dozen capitals to\r\nWashington. The latest I heard of him, he was at Port Arthur. It was\r\nevident that Russia valued his personal address too highly to exile him\r\nbecause of his failure in Washington. Had he threatened or gone about\r\nnoisily, we should all have forgotten him completely. As it is, the\r\nmemory of him to-day is as vivid as his actual presence. Thus, I give\r\nhim what dramatists call an agreeable exit.\r\n\r\nI was in the Baltimore and Potomac station the morning after that\r\nunforgetable night at Senator Blank\u0027s house. I had gone there to see\r\nabout the departure of night trains, preparatory to making a flying\r\ntrip to New York, and was leaving the station when a gloved hand\r\ntouched me on the arm. The hand belonged to Mrs. Chadwick. She was\r\ndressed in the conventional traveling gray, and but for the dark lines\r\nunder her eyes she would have made a picture for any man to admire. She\r\nlooked tired, very tired, as women look who have not slept well.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Mr. Orator,\" she said, saluting me with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"You are going away?\" I asked, shaking her hand cordially.\r\n\r\n\"\u0027Way, \u0027way, away! I am leaving for Nice, where I expect to spend the\r\nwinter. I had intended to remain in Washington till the holidays; but I\r\nplead guilty to a roving disposition, and I frequently change my mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Woman\u0027s most charming prerogative,\" said I, gallantly.\r\n\r\nWhat a mask the human countenance is! How little I dreamed that I was\r\njesting with a woman whose heart was breaking, and numbed with a\r\nterrible pain!\r\n\r\nHer maid came up to announce that everything was ready for her\r\nreception in the state-room, and that the train was about to draw out\r\nof the station. Mrs. Chadwick and I bade each other good-by. Two years\r\npassed before I saw her again.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o\u0027clock I returned to my rooms to pack a case and have the\r\nthing off my mind. Tramping restlessly up and down before my bachelor\r\napartment house I discerned M\u0027sieu Zhames. His face was pale and\r\ntroubled, but the angle of his jaw told me that he had determined upon\r\nsomething or other.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" I said railingly. He wore a decently respectable suit of\r\nready-made clothes. \"Lost your job and want me to give you a\r\nrecommendation?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want a few words with you, Chuck, and no fooling. Don\u0027t say that you\r\ncan\u0027t spare the time. You\u0027ve simply _got_ to.\"\r\n\r\n\"With whom am I to talk, James, the groom, or Warburton, the gentleman?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are to talk with the man whose sister you are to marry.\"\r\n\r\nI became curious, naturally. \"No police affair?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it\u0027s not the police. I can very well go to a lawyer, but I desire\r\nabsolute secrecy. Let us go up to your rooms at once.\"\r\n\r\nI led the way. I was beginning to desire to know what all this meant.\r\n\r\n\"Has anybody recognized you?\" I asked, unlocking the door to my\r\napartment.\r\n\r\n\"No; and I shouldn\u0027t care a hang if they had.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oho!\"\r\n\r\nWarburton flung himself into a chair and lighted a cigar. He puffed it\r\nrapidly, while I got together my shaving and toilet sets.\r\n\r\n\"Start her up,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Chuck, when my father died he left nearly a quarter of a million in\r\nfive per cents; that is to say, Jack, Nancy and I were given a yearly\r\nincome of about forty-five hundred. Nancy\u0027s portion and mine are still\r\nin bonds which do not mature till 1900. Jack has made several bad\r\ninvestments, and about half of his is gone; but his wife has plenty, so\r\nhis losses do not trouble him. Now, I have been rather frugal during\r\nthe past seven years. I have lived entirely upon my Army pay. I must\r\nhave something like twenty-five thousand lying in the bank in New York.\r\nOn Monday, between three and four o\u0027clock, Colonel Annesley will become\r\npractically a beggar, a pauper.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" My shaving-mug slipped from my hand and crashed to the floor,\r\nwhere it lay in a hundred pieces.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. He and his daughter will not have a roof of their own: all gone,\r\nevery stick and stone. Don\u0027t ask me any questions; only do as I ask of\r\nyou.\" He took out his check-book and filled out two blanks. These he\r\nhanded to me. \"The large one I want you to place in the Union bank, to\r\nthe credit of Colonel Annesley.\"\r\n\r\nI looked at the check. \"Twenty thousand dollars?\" I gasped.\r\n\r\n\"The Union bank has this day discounted the colonel\u0027s note. It falls\r\ndue on Monday. In order to meet it, he will have to sell what is left\r\nof the Virginian estate and his fine horses. The interest will be\r\ninconsiderable.\"\r\n\r\n\"What--\" I began, but he interrupted me.\r\n\r\n\"I shall not answer a single question. The check for three thousand is\r\nfor the purchase of the horses, which will be put on sale Saturday\r\nmorning. They are easily worth this amount. Through whatever agency you\r\nplease, buy these horses for me, but not in my name. As for the note,\r\ncash my check first and present the currency for the note. No one will\r\nknow anything about it then. You can not trace money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord, Bob, you are crazy! You are giving away a fortune,\" I\r\nremonstrated.\r\n\r\n\"It is my own, and my capital remains untouched.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you told her that you love her? Does she know who you are?\" I was\r\nvery much excited.\r\n\r\n\"No,\"--sadly, \"I haven\u0027t told her that I love her. She does not know\r\nwho I am. What is more, I never want her to know. I have thrown my arms\r\nroughly around her, thinking her to be Nancy, and have kissed her. Some\r\nreparation is due her. On Monday I shall pack up quietly and return to\r\nthe West\"\r\n\r\n\"Annesley beggared? What in heaven\u0027s name does this all mean?\" I was\r\nconfounded.\r\n\r\n\"Some day, Chuck, when you have entered the family properly as my\r\nsister\u0027s husband, perhaps I may confide in you. At present the secret\r\nisn\u0027t mine. Let it suffice that through peculiar circumstances, the\r\nfather of the girl I love is ruined. I am not doing this for any\r\ntheatrical play, gratitude and all that rot,\"--with half a smile, \"I\r\nadmire and respect Colonel Annesley; I love his daughter, hopelessly\r\nenough. I have never been of much use to any one. Other persons\u0027\r\ntroubles never worried me to any extent; I was happy-go-lucky, careless\r\nand thoughtless. True, I never passed a beggar without dropping a coin\r\ninto his cup. But often this act was the result of a good dinner and a\r\nspecial vintage. The twenty thousand will keep the colonel\u0027s home, the\r\nhouse his child was born in and her mother before her. I am doing this\r\ncrazy thing, as you call it, because it is going to make me rather\r\nhappy. I shall disappear Monday. They may or they may not suspect who\r\nhas come to their aid. They may even trace the thing to you; but you\r\nwill be honor-bound to reveal nothing. When you have taken up the note,\r\nmail it to Annesley. You will find Count Karloff\u0027s name on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Karloff?\" I was in utter darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Annesley borrowed twenty thousand of him on a three months\u0027 note.\r\nBoth men are well known at the Union bank, Karloff having a temporary\r\nlarge deposit there, and Annesley always having done his banking at the\r\nsame place. Karloff, for reasons which I can not tell you, did not turn\r\nin the note till this morning. You will take it up this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Annesley, whom I believed to be a millionaire, penniless; Karloff one\r\nof his creditors? Bob, I do not think that you are treating me fairly.\r\nI can\u0027t go into this thing blind.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you will not do it under these conditions, I shall have to find\r\nsome one who will,\"--resolutely.\r\n\r\nI looked at the checks and then at him.... Twenty-three thousand\r\ndollars! It was more than I ever before held in my hand at one time.\r\nAnd he was giving it away as carelessly as I should have given away a\r\ndime. Then the bigness of the act, the absolute disinterestedness of\r\nit, came to me suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"Bob, you are the finest lover in all the world! And if Miss Annesley\r\never knows who you are, she isn\u0027t a woman if she does not fall\r\nimmediately in love with you.\" I slapped him on the shoulder. I was\r\nsomething of a lover myself, and I could understand.\r\n\r\n\"She will never know. I don\u0027t want her to know. That is why I am going\r\naway. I want to do a good deed, and be left in the dark to enjoy it.\r\nThat is all. After doing this, I could never look her in the eyes as\r\nRobert Warburton. I shall dine with the folks on Sunday. I shall\r\nconfess all only to Nancy, who has always been the only confidante I\r\nhave ever had among the women.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. I could bring no words to my lips. Finally I\r\nstammered out: \"Nancy knows. I told her everything last night. I broke\r\nmy word with you, Bob, but I could not help it She was crying again\r\nover what she thinks to be your heartlessness. I _had_ to tell her.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did she say?\"--rising abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"She laughed, and I do not know when I have seen her look so happy.\r\nThere\u0027ll be a double wedding yet, my boy.\" I was full of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could believe you, Chuck; I wish I could. I\u0027m rather glad you\r\ntold Nan. I love her, and I don\u0027t want her to worry about me.\" He\r\ngripped my hand. \"You will do just as I ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"To the very letter. Will you have a little Scotch to perk you up a\r\nbit? You look rather seedy.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\"--smiling dryly. \"If she smelt liquor on my breath I should lose\r\nmy position. Good-by, then, till Sunday.\"\r\n\r\nI did not go to New York that night. I forgot all about going. Instead,\r\nI went to Nancy, to whom I still go whenever I am in trouble or in\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\nA FINE HEROINE, TOO\r\n\r\n\r\nFriday morning.\r\n\r\nMiss Annesley possessed more than the ordinary amount of force and\r\npower of will. Though the knowledge of it was not patent to her, she\r\nwas a philosopher. She always submitted gracefully to the inevitable.\r\nShe was religious, too, feeling assured that God would provide. She did\r\nnot go about the house, moaning and weeping; she simply studied all\r\nsides of the calamity, and looked around to see what could be saved.\r\nThere were moments when she was even cheerful. There were no new lines\r\nin her face; her eyes were bright and eager. All persons of genuine\r\ntalent look the world confidently in the face; they know exactly what\r\nthey can accomplish. As Karloff had advised her, she did not trouble\r\nherself about the future. Her violin would support her and her father,\r\nperhaps in comfortable circumstances. The knowledge of this gave her a\r\nsilent happiness, that kind which leaves upon the face a serene and\r\nbeautiful calm.\r\n\r\nAt this moment she stood on the veranda, her hand shading her eyes. She\r\nwas studying the sky. The afternoon would be clear; the last ride\r\nshould be a memorable one. The last ride! Tears blurred her eyes and\r\nthere was a smothering sensation in her throat. The last ride! After\r\nto-day Jane would have a new, strange mistress. If only she might go to\r\nthis possible mistress and tell her how much she loved the animal, to\r\nobtain from her the promise that she would be kind to it always. How\r\nmysteriously the human heart spreads its tendrils around the objects of\r\nits love! What is there in the loving of a dog or a horse that, losing\r\none or the other, an emptiness is created? Perhaps it is because the\r\nheart goes out wholly without distrust to the faithful, to the\r\nundeceiving, to the dumb but loving beast, which, for all its strength,\r\nis so helpless.\r\n\r\nShe dropped her hand and spoke to James, who was waiting near by for\r\nher orders.\r\n\r\n\"James, you will have Pierre fill a saddle-hamper; two plates, two\r\nknives and forks, and so forth. We shall ride in the north country this\r\nafternoon. It will be your last ride. To-morrow the horses will be\r\nsold.\" How bravely she said it!\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Miss Annesley.\" Whom were they going to meet in the north\r\ncountry? \"At what hour shall I bring the horses around?\"\r\n\r\n\"At three.\"\r\n\r\nShe entered the house and directed her steps to the study. She found\r\nher father arranging the morning\u0027s mail. She drew up a chair beside\r\nhim, and ran through her own letters. An invitation to lunch with Mrs.\r\nSecretary-of-State; she tossed it into the waste-basket. A dinner-dance\r\nat the Country Club, a ball at the Brazilian legation, a tea at the\r\nGerman embassy, a box party at some coming play, an informal dinner at\r\nthe executive mansion; one by one they fluttered into the basket. A\r\nbill for winter furs, a bill from the dressmaker, one from the\r\nmilliner, one from the glover, and one from the florist; these she laid\r\naside, reckoning their sum-total, and frowning. How could she have been\r\nso extravagant? She chanced to look at her father. He was staring\r\nrather stupidly at a slip of paper which he held in his trembling\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" she asked, vaguely troubled.\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand,\" he said, extending the paper for her inspection.\r\n\r\nNeither did she at first.\r\n\r\n\"Karloff has not done this,\" went on her father, \"for it shows that he\r\nhas had it discounted at the bank. It is canceled; it is paid. I did\r\nnot have twenty thousand in the bank; I did not have even a quarter of\r\nthat amount to my credit. There has been some mistake. Our real estate\r\nagent expects to realize on the home not earlier than Monday morning.\r\nIn case it was not sold then, he was to take up the note personally.\r\nThis is not his work, or I should have been notified.\" Then, with a\r\nburst of grief: \"Betty, my poor Betty! How can you forgive me? How can\r\nI forgive myself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Father, I am brave. Let us forget. It will be better so.\"\r\n\r\nShe kissed his hand and drew it lovingly across her cheek. Then she\r\nrose and moved toward the light. She studied the note carefully. There\r\nwas nothing on it save Karloff\u0027s writing and her father\u0027s and the red\r\nimprint of the bank\u0027s cancelation. Out of the window and beyond she saw\r\nJames leading the horses to the watering trough. Her face suddenly grew\r\ncrimson with shame, and as suddenly as it came the color faded. She\r\nfolded the note and absently tucked it into the bosom of her dress.\r\nThen, as if struck by some strange thought, her figure grew tense and\r\nrigid against the blue background of the sky. The glow which stole over\r\nher features this time had no shame in it, and her eyes shone like the\r\nwaters of sunlit seas. It must never be; no it must never be.\r\n\r\n\"We shall make inquiries at the bank,\" she said. \"And do not be\r\ndowncast, father, the worst is over. What mistakes you have made are\r\nforgotten The future looks bright to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Through innocent young eyes the future is ever bright; but as we age\r\nwe find most of the sunshine on either side, and we stand in the shadow\r\nbetween. Brave heart, I glory in your courage. God will provide for\r\nyou; He will not let my shadow fall on you. Yours shall be the joy of\r\nliving, mine shall be the pain. God bless you! I wonder how I shall\r\never meet your mother\u0027s accusing eyes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Father, you _must_ not dwell upon this any longer; for my sake you\r\nmust not. When everything is paid there will be a little left, enough\r\ntill I and my violin find something to do. After all, the world\u0027s\r\napplause must be a fine thing. I can even now see the criticisms in the\r\ngreat newspapers. \u0027A former young society woman, well-known in the\r\nfashionable circles of Washington, made her _debut_ as a concert player\r\nlast night. She is a stunning young person.\u0027 \u0027A young queen of the\r\ndiplomatic circles, here and abroad, appeared in public as a violinist\r\nlast night. She is a member of the most exclusive sets, and society was\r\nout to do her homage.\u0027 \u0027One of Washington\u0027s brilliant young\r\nhorsewomen,\u0027 and so forth. Away down at the bottom of the column,\r\nsomewhere, they will add that I play the violin rather well for an\r\namateur.\" In all her trial, this was the one bitter expression, and she\r\nwas sorry for it the moment it escaped her. Happily her father was not\r\nlistening. He was wholly absorbed in the mystery of the canceled note.\r\n\r\nShe had mounted Jane and was gathering up the reins, while James\r\nstrapped on the saddle-hamper. This done, he climbed into the saddle\r\nand signified by touching his cap that all was ready. So they rode\r\nforth in the sweet freshness of that November afternoon. A steady wind\r\nwas blowing, the compact white clouds sailed swiftly across the\r\nbrilliant heavens, the leaves whispered and fluttered, hither and\r\nthither, wherever the wind listed; it was the day of days. It was the\r\nlast ride, and fate owed them the compensation of a beautiful afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe last ride! Warburton\u0027s mouth drooped. Never again to ride with her!\r\nHow the thought tightened his heart! What a tug it was going to be to\r\ngive her up! But so it must be. He could never face her gratitude. He\r\nmust disappear, like the good fairies in the story-books. If he left\r\nnow, and she found out what he had done, she would always think kindly\r\nof him, even tenderly. At twilight, when she took out her violin and\r\nplayed soft measures, perhaps a thought or two would be given to him.\r\nAfter what had happened--this contemptible masquerading and the crisis\r\nthrough which her father had just passed--it would be impossible for\r\nher to love him. She would always regard him with suspicion, as a\r\nwitness of her innocent shame.\r\n\r\nHe recalled the two wooden plates in the hamper. Whom was she going to\r\nmeet? Ah, well, what mattered it? After to-day the abyss of eternity\r\nwould yawn between them. How he loved her! How he adored the exquisite\r\nprofile, the warm-tinted skin, the shining hair!... And he had lost\r\nher! Ah, that last ride!\r\n\r\nThe girl was holding her head high because her heart was full. No more\r\nto ride on a bright morning, with the wind rushing past her, bringing\r\nthe odor of the grasses, of the flowers, of the earth to tingle her\r\nnostrils; no more to follow the hounds on a winter\u0027s day, with the pack\r\nbaying beyond the hedges, the gay, red-coated riders sweeping down the\r\nfield; no more to wander through the halls of her mother\u0027s birthplace\r\nand her own! Like a breath on a mirror, all was gone. Why? What had\r\n_she_ done to be flung down ruthlessly? She, who had been brought up in\r\nidleness and luxury, must turn her hands to a living! Without being\r\nworldly, she knew the world. Once she appeared upon the stage, she\r\nwould lose caste among her kind. True, they would tolerate her, but no\r\nlonger would her voice be heard or her word have weight.\r\n\r\nSoon she would be tossed about on the whirlpool and swallowed up. Then\r\nwould come the haggling with managers, long and tiresome journeys,\r\ngloomy hotels and indifferent fare, curious people who desired to see\r\nthe one-time fashionable belle; her portraits would be lithographed and\r\nhung in shop-windows, in questionable resorts, and the privacy so loved\r\nby gentlewomen gone; and perhaps there would be insults. And she was\r\nonly on the threshold of the twenties, the radiant, blooming twenties!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Go home, Colonel--and stay home!\"--ACT III.]\r\n\r\nDuring the long ride (for they covered something like seven miles) not\r\na word was spoken. The girl was biding her time; the man had nothing to\r\nvoice. They were going through the woods, when they came upon a\r\nclearing through which a narrow brook loitered or sallied down the\r\nincline. She reined in and raised her crop. He was puzzled. So far as\r\nhe could see, he and the girl were alone. The third person, for whom,\r\nhe reasoned, he had brought the second plate, was nowhere in sight.\r\n\r\nA flat boulder lay at the side of the stream, and she nodded toward it.\r\nWarburton emptied the hamper and spread the cloth on the stone. Then he\r\nlaid out the salad, the sandwiches, the olives, the almonds, and two\r\nsilver telescope-cups. All this time not a single word from either;\r\nWarburton, busied with his task, did not lift his eyes to her.\r\n\r\nThe girl had laid her face against Jane\u0027s nose, and two lonely tears\r\ntrailed slowly down her velvety cheeks. Presently he was compelled to\r\nlook at her and speak.\r\n\r\n\"Everything is ready, Miss.\" He spoke huskily. The sight of her tears\r\ngave him an indescribable agony.\r\n\r\nShe dropped the bridle-reins, brushed her eyes, and the sunshine of a\r\nsmile broke through the troubled clouds.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Warburton,\" she said gently, \"let us not play any more. I am too\r\nsad. Let us hang up the masks, for the comedy is done.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\nTHE CASTLE OF ROMANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nHow silent the forest was! The brook no longer murmured, the rustle of\r\nthe leaves was without sound. A spar of sunshine, filtering through the\r\nragged limbs of the trees, fell aslant her, and she stood in an\r\naureola. As for my hero, a species of paralysis had stricken him\r\nmotionless and dumb. It was all so unexpected, all so sudden, that he\r\nhad the sensation of being whirled away from reality and bundled\r\nunceremoniously into the unreal.... She knew, and had known! A leaf\r\nbrushed his face, but he was senseless to the touch of it. All he had\r\nthe power to do was to stare at her. . . . She knew, and had known!\r\n\r\nDick stepped into the brook and began to paw the water, and the\r\nintermission of speech and action came to an end.\r\n\r\n\"You-and you knew?\" What a strange sound his voice had in his own ears!\r\n\r\n\"Yes. From the very beginning--I knew you to be a gentleman in\r\nmasquerade; that is to say, when I saw you in the police-court. The\r\nabsence of the beard confused me at first, but presently I recognized\r\nthe gentleman whom I had noticed on board the ship.\"\r\n\r\nSo she had noticed him!\r\n\r\n\"That night you believed me to be your sister Nancy. But I did not know\r\nthis till lately. And the night I visited her she exhibited some\r\nphotographs. Among these was a portrait of you without a beard.\"\r\n\r\nWarburton started. And the thought that this might be the case had\r\nnever trickled through his thick skull! How she must have laughed at\r\nhim secretly!\r\n\r\nShe continued: \"Even then I was not sure. But when Colonel Raleigh\r\ndeclared that you resembled a former lieutenant of his, then I knew.\"\r\nShe ceased. She turned to her horse as if to gather the courage to go\r\non; but Jane had her nose hidden in the stream, and was oblivious of\r\nher mistress\u0027 need.\r\n\r\nHe waited dully for her to resume, for he supposed that she had not yet\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\"I have humiliated you in a hundred ways, and for this I want you to\r\nforgive me. I sent the butler away for the very purpose of making you\r\nserve in his stead. But you were so good about it all, with never a\r\nmurmur of rebellion, that I grew ashamed of my part in the comedy. But\r\nnow--\" Her eyes closed and her body swayed; but she clenched her hands,\r\nand the faintness passed away. \"But for you, my poor father would have\r\nbeen dishonored, and I should have been forced into the arms of a man\r\nwhom I despise. Whenever I have humiliated you, you have returned the\r\ngift of a kind deed. You will forgive me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Forgive you? There is nothing for me to forgive on my side, much on\r\nyours. It is you who should forgive me. What you have done I have\r\ndeserved.\" His tongue was thick and dry. How much did she know?\r\n\r\n\"No, not wholly deserved it.\" She fumbled with the buttons of her\r\nwaist; her eyes were so full that she could not see. She produced an\r\noblong slip of paper.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw it, a breath as of ice enveloped him. The thing she held\r\nout toward him was the canceled note. For a while he did me the honor\r\nto believe that I had betrayed him.\r\n\r\n\"I understand the kind and generous impulse which prompted this deed.\r\nOh, I admire it, and I say to you, God bless you! But don\u0027t you see how\r\nimpossible it is? It can not be; no, no! My father and I are proud.\r\nWhat we owe we shall pay. Poverty, to be accepted without plaint, must\r\nbe without debts of gratitude. But it was noble and great of you; and I\r\nknew that you intended to run away without ever letting any one know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who told you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one. I guessed it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he might have denied all knowledge of it!\r\n\r\n\"Won\u0027t you--won\u0027t you let it be as it is? I have never done anything\r\nworth while before, and this has made me happy. Won\u0027t you let me do\r\nthis? Only you need know. I am going away on Monday, and it will be\r\nyears before I see Washington again. No one need ever know.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked away. In her mind\u0027s eye she could see this man leading a\r\ntroop through a snow-storm. How the wind roared! How the snow whirled\r\nand eddied about them, or suddenly blotted them from sight! But, on and\r\non, resolutely, courageously, hopefully, he led them on to safety....\r\nHe was speaking, and the picture dissolved.\r\n\r\n\"Won\u0027t you let it remain just as it is?\" he pleaded.\r\n\r\nHer head moved negatively, and once more she extended the note. He took\r\nit and slowly tore it into shreds. With it he was tearing up the dream\r\nand tossing it down the winds.\r\n\r\n\"The money will be placed to your credit at the bank on Monday. We can\r\nnot accept such a gift from any one. You would not, I know. But always\r\nshall I treasure the impulse. It will give me courage in the\r\nfuture--when I am fighting alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I? I am going to appear before the public,\"--with assumed lightness;\r\n\"I and my violin.\"\r\n\r\nHe struck his hands together. \"The stage?\"--horrified.\r\n\r\n\"I must live,\"--calmly.\r\n\r\n\"But a servant to public caprice? It ought not to be! I realize that I\r\ncan not force you to accept my gift, but this I shall do: I shall buy\r\nin the horses and give them back to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mustn\u0027t. I shall have no place to put them. Oh!\"--with a gesture\r\nfull of despair and unshed tears, \"why have you done all this? Why this\r\nmean masquerade, this submitting to the humiliations I have contrived\r\nfor you, this act of generosity? Why?\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps she knew the answers to her own questions, but, womanlike,\r\nwanted to be told.\r\n\r\nAnd at that moment, though I am not sure, I believe Warburton\u0027s\r\nguarding angel gave him some secret advice.\r\n\r\n\"You ask me why I have played the fool in the motley?\"--finding the\r\nstrength of his voice. \"Why I have submitted in silence to your just\r\nhumiliations? Why I have acted what you term generously? Do you mean to\r\ntell me that you have not guessed the riddle?\"\r\n\r\nShe turned her delicate head aside and switched the grasses with her\r\nriding-crop.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\"--flinging aside his cap, which he had been holding in his hand,\r\n\"I will tell you. I wanted to be near you. I wanted to be, what you\r\nmade me, your servant. It is the one great happiness that I have known.\r\nI have done all these things because--because, God help me, I love you!\r\nYes, I love you, with every beat of my heart!\"--lifting his head\r\nproudly. Upon his face love had put the hallowed seal. \"Do not turn\r\nyour head away, for my love is honest. I ask nothing, nothing; I expect\r\nnothing. I know that it is hopeless. What woman could love a man who\r\nhas made himself ridiculous in her eyes, as I have made myself in\r\nyours?\"--bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"No, not ridiculous; never that!\" she interrupted, her face still\r\naverted.\r\n\r\nHe strode toward her hastily, and for a moment her heart almost ceased\r\nto beat. But all he did was to kneel at her feet and kiss the hem of\r\nher riding-skirt. He rose hurriedly.\r\n\r\n\"God bless you, and good-by!\" He knew that if he remained he would lose\r\nall control, crush her madly in his arms, and hurt her lips with his\r\ndespairing kisses. He had not gone a dozen paces, when he heard her\r\ncall pathetically. He stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Warburton, surely you are not going to leave me here alone with\r\nthe horses?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, I did not think! I am confused!\" he blundered.\r\n\r\n\"You are modest, too.\" Why is it that, at the moment a man succumbs to\r\nhis embarrassment, a woman rises above hers? \"Come nearer,\"--a command\r\nwhich he obeyed with some hesitation. \"You have been a groom, a butler,\r\nall for the purpose of telling me that you love me. Listen. Love is\r\nlike a pillar based upon a dream: one by one we lay the stones of\r\nbeauty, of courage, of faith, of honor, of steadfastness. We wake, and\r\nhow the beautiful pillar tumbles about our ears! What right have you to\r\nbuild up your pillar upon a dream of me? What do you know of the real\r\nwoman--for I have all the faults and vanities of the sex; what do you\r\nknow of me? How do you know that I am not selfish? that I am constant?\r\nthat I am worthy a man\u0027s loving?\"\r\n\r\n\"Love is not like Justice, with a pair of scales to weigh this or that.\r\nI do not ask _why_ I love you; the knowledge is all I need. And you are\r\n_not_ selfish, inconstant, and God knows that you are worth loving. As\r\nI said, I ask for nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand,\" she continued, as if she had not heard his\r\ninterpolation, \"I know you thoroughly. I have had evidence of your\r\ncourage, your steadfastness, your unselfishness. Do not misunderstand\r\nme. I am proud that you love me. This love of yours, which asks for no\r\nreward, only the right to confess, ought to make any good woman happy,\r\nwhether she loved or not. And you would have gone away without telling\r\nme, even!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\" He dug into the earth with his riding-boot. If only she knew how\r\nshe was crucifying him!\r\n\r\n\"Why were you going away without telling me?\"\r\n\r\nHe was dumb.\r\n\r\nHer arms and eyes, uplifted, appealed to heaven. \"What shall I say? How\r\nshall I make him understand?\" she murmured. \"You love me, and you ask\r\nfor nothing? Is it because in spirit my father has committed a\r\ncrime?\"--growing tall and darting a proud glance at him.\r\n\r\n\"Good heaven, do not believe that!\" he cried,\r\n\r\n\"What _am_ I to believe?\"--tapping the ground with her boot so that the\r\nspur jingled.\r\n\r\nA pause.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Warburton, do you know what a woman loves in a man? I will tell\r\nyou the secret. She loves courage, constancy, and honor, purpose that\r\nsurmounts obstacles; she loves pursuit; she loves the hour of\r\nsurrender. Every woman builds a castle of romance and waits for Prince\r\nCharming to enter, and once he does, there must be a game of hide and\r\nseek. Perhaps I have built my castle of romance, too. I wait for Prince\r\nCharming, and--a man comes, dressed as a groom. There has been a game\r\nof hide and seek, but somehow he has tripped. Will you not ask me if I\r\nlove you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no! I understand. I do not want your gratitude. You are meeting\r\ngenerosity with generosity. I do not want your gratitude.\"--brokenly.\r\n\"I want your love, every thought of your mind, every beat of your\r\nheart. Can you give me these, honestly?\"\r\n\r\nShe drew off a glove. Her hand became lost in her bosom. When she drew\r\nit forth she extended it, palm upward. Upon it lay a faded, withered\r\nrose. Once more she turned her face away.\r\n\r\nHe was at her side, and the hand and rose were crushed between his two\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\"Can you give what I ask? Your love, your thoughts, your heart-beats?\"\r\n\r\nIt was her turn to remain dumb.\r\n\r\n\"Can you?\" He drew her toward him perhaps roughly, being unconscious of\r\nhis strength and the nervous energy which the sight of the rose had\r\ncalled into being.\r\n\r\n\"Can we give those things which are--already--given?\"\r\n\r\nOnly Warburton and the angels, or rather the angels and Warburton, to\r\nget at the chronological order of things, heard her, so low had grown\r\nher voice.\r\n\r\nYou may tell any kind of secret to a horse; the animal will never\r\nbetray you. Warburton would never tell me what followed; and I am too\r\nsensible to hang around the horses in hopes of catching them in the act\r\nof talking over the affair among themselves. But I can easily imagine\r\nthis bit of equine dialogue:\r\n\r\n_Jane_: Did you ever see such foolishness?\r\n\r\n_Dick_: Never! And with all this good grass about!\r\n\r\nWhatever _did_ follow caused the girl to murmur: \"This is the lover I\r\nlove; this is the lover I have been waiting for in my castle of\r\nromance. I am glad that I have lost all worldly things; I am glad,\r\nglad! When did you first learn that you loved me?\"\r\n\r\n(Old, very old; thousands of years old, and will grow to be many\r\nthousand years older. But from woman\u0027s lips it is the sweetest question\r\nman ever heard.)\r\n\r\n\"At the _Gare du Nord_, in Paris; the first time I saw you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you followed me across the ocean?\"--wonderingly.\r\n\r\n\"And when did you first learn that you loved me?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n(Oh, the trite phrases of lovers\u0027 litany.)\r\n\r\n\"When I saw you in the police-court. Mercy! what a scandal! I am to\r\nmarry my butler!\"\r\n\r\n_Jane:_ They are laughing!\r\n\r\n_Dick:_ That is better than weeping. Besides, they will probably walk\r\nus home. (Wise animal!)\r\n\r\nHe was not only wise but prophetic. The lovers _did_ walk the horses\r\nhome. Hand in hand they came back along the road, through the flame and\r\nflush of the ripening year. The god of light burned in the far west,\r\nblending the brown earth with his crimson radiance, while the purple\r\nshadows of the approaching dusk grew larger and larger. The man turned.\r\n\r\n\"What a beautiful world it is!\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I begin to find it so,\" replied the girl, looking not at the world,\r\nbut at him.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPostscript:\r\n\r\nI believe they sent William back for the saddle-hamper and my jehu\u0027s\r\ncap."
