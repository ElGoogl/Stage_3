Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.",

Compiled Especially with Reference to Those Numerous\r\nVisitors Who Can Spare but Two or Three Days to Make the Tour of the\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nPrinted and Published by George Brannon, Wootton, Isle of Wight\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Pulpit Rock, Bonchurch, looking towards Ventnor.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORRIS, I.W.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf nearly FORTY YEARS\u0027 RESIDENCE in the Isle of Wight may be allowed in\r\nsome degree to qualify an ARTIST for the office of Guide, the Author has\r\na fair claim to public patronage,--for few could have had better\r\nopportunity of acquiring local information.\r\n\r\nHe has endeavoured to render THE PICTURE an intelligent _Cicerone_,\r\nwithout being too garrulous or grandiloquous,--but always attentive to\r\nthe stranger, leading him to every remarkable object, and giving just as\r\nmuch description of each, as would be acceptable to persons enjoying the\r\nfull use of their eyes. It affords him, _at first glance_, an INDEX of\r\nwhat ought to be seen, and _how best seen in the shortest time_, in\r\nevery place to which he may be successively conducted. This novelty in\r\nthe work will prove very frequently of great utility, especially to\r\nthose visitors who have too little time for their trip, and who, for\r\nwant of such a laconic memento wherever they go, are known in a thousand\r\ninstances to pass by the most interesting objects unnoticed,--not being\r\naware even of their proximity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis being the production of the same hand as several other local\r\nworks, it is due to the stranger to explain in what respects they\r\ndiffer:--\r\n\r\nI.--THE VECTIS SCENERY is a handsome volume in Royal Quarto,\r\nsubstantially bound, containing 36 highly finished line-engravings of\r\nall the most celebrated landscapes, accompanied with ample letter-press\r\ndescriptions, price £1.5.0.\r\n\r\nII.--THE PICTURE differs from the above in being intended for a\r\n_hand-book_, it is in fact a Cicerone, and therefore occasionally dwells\r\nwith a degree of minuteness which could be interesting only to a person\r\nactually on the spot; but the \"Vectis Scenery\" takes the higher rank of\r\nan Exhibitor of picturesque scenes which ask little aid from verbal\r\nexplanation, and is entitled to a place on the drawing-room table with\r\nother works of Art.

But generally, its landscapes are more distinguished\r\nfor beauty than sublimity, and hence the very appropriate designation of\r\n\"THE GARDEN OF ENGLAND!\" an emphatic compliment cheerfully paid by the\r\nthousands annually visiting its shores for pleasure or for health: and\r\nperhaps there is scarcely another spot in the kingdom, of the same\r\nnarrow limits, which can concentrate more of those qualities that at\r\nonce charm the eye and animate the soul. Nor should it be overlooked how\r\nlarge a source of interest is derived from the proximity of those two\r\ncelebrated towns, Southampton and Portsmouth: and the beautiful\r\ntermination given to most of the open prospects by the retiring\r\ndistances on the opposite coast.\r\n\r\n                 ----\"Intermixture sweet,\r\n    Of lawns and groves, of open and retired,\r\n    Vales, farms, towns, villas, castles, distant spires.\r\n    And hills on hills with ambient clouds enrolled,\r\n    In long succession court the lab\u0027ring sight.\"\r\n\r\nBut the crowning beauty of the Island is certainly THE SEA! viewed in\r\nall the splendor of its various aspects;--whether under the awful\r\ngrandeur of the agitated and boundless _Ocean_,--as a rapid and\r\nmagnificent _River_,--or reposing in all the glassy tranquillity of a\r\nspacious land-locked _Bay_:--now of a glowing crimson, and now of the\r\npurest depth of azure: its bosom ever spangled with a thousand moving\r\nand attractive objects of marine life.\r\n\r\nTo those who have never had the opportunity of viewing the sea except\r\nunder the comparatively dreary aspect which it presents from many\r\nunsheltering parts of the southern coast, as for instance Brighton,\r\nwhere almost the only relief to the monotony of the wide expanse is a\r\nfew clumsy fishing boats or dusky colliers, and occasionally the rolling\r\nclouds of smoke from a passing steamer,--it may seem that we are rather\r\ndisposed to exaggerate the picture; but not so, as would certainly be\r\nattested by every one who had visited the island: for here the scene is\r\never enriched by magnificent SHIPS OF WAR, innumerable merchant-vessels,\r\nand splendid pleasure-yachts, safely lying at anchor or gaily sailing\r\nabout in every direction; and what moving object in the world can\r\nsurpass, in grandeur, beauty, and interest, a fine ship under full\r\ncanvass with a light breeze? Let the reader only imagine how glorious a\r\nsight it must have been, when 200 sail,--line-of-battle-ships, frigates,\r\nand large merchantmen under convoy, would weigh anchor at the same time,\r\nand proceeding on their voyage, _pass round the island_ as it were in\r\nreview!--thus affording a spectacle, as they floated\r\n\r\n    \"O\u0027er the glad waters of the dark blue sea,\"\r\n\r\nnever to be erased from the memory of those who had once the\r\nincomparable pleasure to witness it. True it is, that in these happier\r\ntimes of peace, such exhibitions are not to be expected: but frequently\r\neven now, very large fleets of merchantmen, and perhaps several\r\nmen-of-war, which have put in through distress of weather, or been\r\ndetained by contrary winds, will all at the same moment weigh anchor at\r\nthe first favorable change. [Footnote: The glories of the olden time\r\nhave of late years been frequently revived at the departure of\r\nExperimental and other squadrons rendezvousing at Spithead,--accompanied\r\nas they sometimes are by hundreds of sailing-craft and steamers,\r\nincluding the beautiful yachts of all the neighbouring clubs.]\r\n\r\nWe think it ridiculous to attribute qualities to the island (as is\r\noften done,) which it really does not possess: all we contend for is,\r\nthat few spots can excel the Wight _altogether in the amount of its_\r\nVARIOUS _attractions_; we mean especially to those parties who can only\r\nsnatch occasionally a very brief period for a summer excursion; not only\r\nas regards its _peculiar and acknowledged local advantages_, but equally\r\nso from those adventitious and auxiliary circumstances that are derived\r\nfrom the present _rail-road_ conveyance from the metropolis: and from\r\nthe _shortness_ and _perfect safety_ of the passage across--being little\r\nmore than an hour from Southampton, and only half that time from\r\nPortsmouth; the former an important mercantile port and fashionable\r\nwatering-place; and the latter, the first naval station in the\r\nkingdom--its marine treasures too thrown open gratuitously to public\r\ninspection: and what curiosity can afford a Briton more gratification,\r\nthan to visit such a dock-yard, and pace the deck of the very ship in\r\nwhich _Victory_ crowned the last moments of the immortal Nelson?\r\n\r\nThough the island has to boast of many passages of highly romantic and\r\n_brilliant_ scenery, yet the predominant character of its landscapes is,\r\nas was hinted above, calculated to amuse, to delight, and promote\r\n_cheerfulness_, rather than to astonish or impress the spectator with\r\nfeelings of awe by their stupendous grandeur; circumstances which,\r\ncombined with its salubrity of climate, render it a most desirable\r\nretreat to the valetudinarian and nervous invalid: indeed all the\r\nalterations which have latterly been made, or are now in progress, tend\r\nto soften, embellish, and in point of convenience to improve the face of\r\nthe country. On this subject however it will be a question with many\r\npersons of good taste, whether any of these artificial operations are\r\nreally improvements upon the native character of the island. An artist\r\nwould most probably decide in the negative: but we know there are many\r\nnevertheless, who consider that whatever deterioration the island may\r\nexperience in some of her more wild and romantic features, is amply\r\ncompensated by the spread of cultivation and rural decoration, by the\r\nincreased facilities of travelling, and the multiplied means of\r\nenjoyment now afforded to the pleasure-tourist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few particulars will suffice for the present, to prove the above\r\nassertions, and may perhaps be found\r\n\r\nUSEFUL HINTS TO STRANGERS\r\n\r\nPurposing a visit to the shores of the Garden of England. They may\r\narrange to breakfast comfortably at the usual hour in London--start by\r\nthe rail-road, and reach either of the above ports at noon, or even\r\nearlier--steam-packets are in readiness to convey the passengers across,\r\nand stage-coaches and other vehicles await their arrival at Cowes and\r\nRyde: our friends may then _ride round one-half_ of the island, and\r\nreturn the next, or even _the same night!_ but this of course is\r\nabridging the affair a little too much. But allow a full week, and that\r\nwill suffice to render it a very pleasant trip. If, for example, you\r\ncome to Southampton, sleep there, or at least tarry a few hours in the\r\nexamination of it: then take the last steamer to Cowes or Ryde, and\r\nsleep there the first night: next morning commence the regular Tour of\r\nthree days, dining and sleeping twice or thrice at one or other of the\r\ninns situated on the rocky side of the island, to enjoy at the same time\r\nthe more unusual feast of a wide prospect of the sea, and the music of\r\nthe foaming breakers thundering on the beach below. Supposing you start\r\nfrom Cowes, as being opposite Southampton, the Route will bring you\r\nround to Ryde; where you cross to Portsmouth, and having gone over the\r\nfortifications, the dock-yard, and Nelson\u0027s ship, return by one or other\r\nof the rail-roads. But if you arrive by Portsmouth and Ryde, then return\r\n_via_ Cowes and \u0027Hampton.--For the details of the several routes, the\r\nreader is of course referred to the chapter \"Tours,\" at the end of the\r\nWork.\r\n\r\nThat part of the island immediately opposite Hampshire is generally\r\nwell-wooded, with an easy descent to the shore--populous and busy, as\r\nmight be expected from the two considerable watering-places before\r\nnamed, and several excellent harbors. But the south side (familiarly\r\ncalled _the Back of the Island_,) being washed by the impetuous tides of\r\nthe ocean, presents a very different aspect, showing the resistless\r\nprogress of the waves:--and hence perpendicular cliffs of great\r\naltitude, precipitous slopes constantly detaching large masses of earth\r\nand rocks, and all the picturesque confusion produced by successive\r\nlandslips: here therefore the scenery is variously characterized by\r\ndreary devastation, romantic beauty, or sublime splendor of effect. But\r\nnot so of _the Interior_ of the island, which presents the softer\r\npictures of pastoral and rural life: for ...\r\n\r\n    \"Creation\u0027s mildest charms are here combined,\"\r\n\r\nenlivened by several splendid mansions, with their parks and groves. The\r\nchurches are numerous: some \"embosomed soft in trees,\" and others\r\npicturesquely seated on commanding knolls: and many of the highest hills\r\nare adorned by a light-house or signal-station--some lofty obelisk,\r\ntower, or mill; so that in every direction a conspicuous object gives an\r\ninterest and discriminative identity to those broad features of scenery,\r\nwhich would otherwise be perfectly tame and monotonous.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Situation, Extent, Climate, \u0026c._\r\n\r\nThe Isle of Wight extends from east to west 23 miles, by about 14 from\r\nnorth to south (being very nearly the figure of a lozenge),\r\ncircumscribes at least 60 miles, and contains upwards of 100,000 acres.\r\nIt is separated from the Hampshire coast by a strait called the SOLENT\r\nSEA, varying from three to seven miles in width: and bounded by the\r\nBritish Channel on the south--the nearest part of the French coast being\r\nCherbourg (18 leagues distant), which is said to have been seen from the\r\nhills of Freshwater, \u0026c. The extent of the English coast visible in\r\nclear weather is above 100 miles, from Beachy Head in Sussex, to the\r\nIsle of Portland in Dorset.\r\n\r\nTHE CLIMATE.--The purity of the air was always acknowledged by those who\r\never visited the island owing to the dry and highly cultivated face of\r\nthe country: but it was left to an eminent Physician, Dr. James Clarke,\r\nto give due celebrity to the unrivaled salubrity of the climate:--\r\n\r\n\"The Island, from the variety which it presents in point of elevation,\r\nsoil, and aspect, and from the configuration of its hills and shores,\r\npossesses several peculiarities of climate and situation, which render\r\nit a very favorable and commodious residence throughout the year, for a\r\nlarge class of invalids. On this account, the Isle of Wight claims our\r\nparticular attention, as it comprehends within itself advantages which\r\nare of great value to the delicate invalid, and to obtain which, in\r\nalmost any other part of England, he would require to make a\r\nconsiderable journey.\" And he further remarks, that \"the Undercliff bids\r\nfair to exceed all other winter residences in this country, and the\r\nisland will have added to its title of the Garden of England, that of\r\nthe BRITISH MADEIRA.\"\r\n\r\nThe classical designation of the island is VECTA or VECTIS: but its\r\nmodern name is derived from Wect, With, or Wict, as it is found\r\nvariously written in Doomsday Book.\r\n\r\n     Some writers have supposed the island to have been once connected\r\n     with the mainland by an isthmus stretching from Gurnet, near Cowes,\r\n     to Leap, on the Hampshire roast; but nothing decisive has yet been\r\n     advanced in support of this strange hypothesis.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the island presents a constant succession of valley and\r\neminence--the two principal chains of hills being ... a range of chalk\r\ndowns of a smooth rounded shape, and from 500 to 700 feet high, that\r\nstretch lengthways through the middle of the island, abutting the ocean\r\nat Freshwater on the west, and Bembridge on the east:-and a still\r\nloftier range, variously composed of chalk, firestone, \u0026c., that skirts\r\nthe south-eastern coast from Shanklin Down to St. Catharine\u0027s (the\r\nlatter 830 feet in height,) and whose broken flank on the sea-side forms\r\nthe celebrated and romantic region of the UNDERCLIFF.\r\n\r\nThe principal streams in the Isle of Wight navigable for marine craft\r\nare the Rivers Medina and Yar, and the Creeks of Newtown and\r\nWootton.--The Medina, whose source is in the south, and which joins the\r\nsea at Cowes, divides the island into two hundreds of nearly equal\r\nextent, respectively called the East and West Medene; the first\r\ncomprising 14, the latter 16 parishes.\r\n\r\nThe population of the island has doubled since 1802, and now exceeds\r\n45,000. No manufacture of any consequence is carried on (with the\r\nexception of the lace-factory near Newport,) Corn being the staple\r\narticle of trade,--for which there are about 42 mills, nearly all of\r\nthem worked by water.\r\n\r\nAlmost encompassed by formidable rocks and shelves, few parts of the\r\nEnglish coast are more dangerous to ships driving in a storm. The most\r\ndreaded parts are the Needles and Shingles, at the western point;\r\nRocken-end Race at the south, and Bembridge Ledge at the eastern\r\nextremity: few winters pass without the melancholy catastrophe of\r\nshipwreck; though the danger is now of course diminished by the\r\nestablishment of Light-houses--especially of the new one near\r\nNiton.--Owing to this cause, and to the precipitous nature of the coast\r\nitself, the island presents few points favorable to an enemy\u0027s landing,\r\nand even those were for the most part fortified by order of Henry VIII:\r\nThe forts of Sandown, Cowes, and Yarmouth still remain; and though they\r\nmight be of little use in the present state of military science, the\r\npresence of \"England\u0027s wooden walls\" at the stations of Spithead and St.\r\nHelen\u0027s, renders all local defences needless.\r\n\r\n_Geology, Agriculture, and Zoology_.\r\n\r\nThe island presents many rare geological phenomena: and from its\r\nsmallness, easy access, and the various nature of its coasts, offers an\r\nadmirable field for scientific investigation.\r\n\r\nOne peculiarity deserves to be particularly noticed; namely, the\r\nextraordinary state in which the FLINTS are found in the great range of\r\nchalk hills,--for all those in regular beds, are broken into pieces in\r\nevery direction, from two or three inches long, to an almost impalpable\r\npowder; and yet show no other indication of their fracture than very\r\nfine lines, until the investing chalk be removed, when they fall at once\r\nto pieces! But the separate flints or nodules in the body of the chalk\r\nstrata are not so: which led the late Sir H. Englefield to conjecture,\r\nthat the phenomenon was caused in the moment of the immense concussion\r\nwhich subverted the whole mass of strata, and placed them in their\r\npresent nearly vertical position.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting circumstance in the geological structure of the Isle\r\nof Wight, is a series of strata, _vertical_ or highly inclined, which\r\nrun across the middle of it from east to west; while the strata on each\r\nside are _horizontal_; they consist of ... a very thick stratum of clay\r\nand sand (observable at Alum Bay), flinty chalk, chalk without flints,\r\nchalk-marle, green sandstone with lime-stone and chert, dark-grey marle,\r\nand ferruginous sand.\r\n\r\nA PROGRESSIVE CHANGE is evidently taking place in the boundary line of\r\nthe coast--the sea making considerable invasions on the south side,\r\nwhich is exposed to the resistless currents of the ocean; while on the\r\nnorth it is found to be more gradually receding, from the accumulation\r\nof sand and shingle drifted and deposited by the less impetuous tides of\r\nthe Solent Channel.--About Brixton, for instance, between Blackgang\r\nChine and the Freshwater Cliffs, the loss of land has been estimated\r\n(from the successive removals of paths and hedges,) to exceed 200 feet\r\nin breadth in less than a century; while in the neighbourhood of Ryde it\r\nis known that the bed of a valley formerly accessible to the sea is now\r\nrather above its highest level; and even in 1760, when Fielding visited\r\nthe island, the coast there is described by him as a wide disgusting\r\nwaste of mud, which is now covered with an increasing layer of sand,\r\nsufficiently firm to bear wheel-carriages; and no doubt but in process\r\nof time there will be a great accession to the beach, from the constant\r\nthough slow operation of the same causes--denuding on the one side, and\r\nreciprocally accumulating on the other.\r\n\r\nGood Stone of various qualities is found in most parts of the island:\r\nand with that procured from the quarries of Binstead, the body of\r\nWinchester Cathedral was built. All the houses along the Undercliff are\r\nconstructed with a beautiful kind of freestone procured on the spot.\r\n\r\n     Extensive pits are worked in the downs for the chalk, which is used\r\n     for manure, burning into lime, \u0026c. A stratum of coals was formerly\r\n     believed to run through the central downs, and Sir Rt. Worsley\r\n     actually sunk a shaft for it near Bembridge; his labors however\r\n     were but poorly rewarded. Veins of coarse iron ore have also\r\n     appeared in some parts of the island.\r\n\r\nThe finest white sand in the kingdom is obtained from the sea-cliffs at\r\nFreshwater, and is carried in great quantities to the glass and\r\nporcelain manufactories. Excellent brick-earth abounds in almost every\r\npart of the island: common native alum, copperas, specimens of\r\npetrifactions, and many curious varieties of sea-weeds, are picked up on\r\nthe shores; in the cliffs and quarries are found numerous beautiful\r\nfossil remains,--especially oysters and other bivalve shells, of a vast\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nThe central range of chalk hills divides the island into two nearly\r\ndistinct regions, the soil and strata being essentially different,--a\r\nstiff clay predominating on the north side, which is extensively covered\r\nwith wood, while the south side is principally of a light sandy soil or\r\nmellow loam, and being exceedingly fertile, the whole tract is almost\r\nexclusively employed in tillage.\r\n\r\n     In geological terms, the north is formed of the _Eocene_ or\r\n     freshwater deposits: and the south of the _Cretaceous_ or oceanic,\r\n     except where the _Wealden_ exhibits itself at Sandown and Brixton\r\n     bays.--Though affording a great variety of soil, the island is upon\r\n     the whole well calculated for farming as may be inferred from its\r\n     proverbial fertility; \"it was many years ago computed to produce as\r\n     much corn in one year as its inhabitants would consume in\r\n     seven,--and the improved cultivation, with the additional land\r\n     brought into tillage, has doubtless kept pace with the increased\r\n     population.\"\r\n\r\nIn AGRICULTURE there is now a close approximation to the routine\r\npractised in the rest of the county: and there is scarcely any\r\npeculiarity observable either in the system of Husbandry, or in the\r\nmanners of the Yeomanry, who are a very intelligent and respectable\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n     The constant intercourse which the inhabitants have with persons\r\n     from other parts of the kingdom, has in fact erased all insular\r\n     peculiarities. But the following extract from the Memoirs of Sir\r\n     John Oglander, which were written about the year 1700, will be read\r\n     with interest, as exhibiting a most\r\n\r\n     _Amusing Picture of the Islanders in the 16th century_.\r\n\r\n     \"I have heard,\" says he, \"and partly knowe it to be true, that not\r\n     only heretofore there was no lawyer nor attorney in owre island,\r\n     but in Sir George Carey\u0027s time [1588] an attorney coming in to\r\n     settle in the island, was by his command, with a pound of candles\r\n     hanging att his breech lighted, with bells about his legs, hunted\r\n     owte of the island; insomuch that owre ancestors lived here so\r\n     quietly and securely, being neither troubled to London nor\r\n     Winchester, so they seldom or never went owte of the island;\r\n     insomuch as when they went to London (thinking it an East India\r\n     voyage), they always made their wills, supposing no trouble like to\r\n     travaile.\"\r\n\r\nThe extensive downs of the island afford excellent pasture for sheep,\r\nwhose wool is of a staple not inferior to that produced on the South\r\nDowns: and many thousand lambs are annually sent to the London markets.\r\nFrom the improvements effected in Husbandry, there are now nearly\r\nsufficient oxen reared and fatted for the use of the inhabitants,\r\ninstead of the butchers going as formerly, to Salisbury, \u0026c. for their\r\ncattle.\r\n\r\nThe demands of the dock-yards (both here and at Portsmouth,) have\r\ngreatly thinned the timber of the island, which is principally oak and\r\nelm, and is found to grow most luxuriantly in the wooded tract from East\r\nCowes to St. Helen\u0027s.\r\n\r\n     In the time of King Charles II, woods were so extensive, that it is\r\n     recorded, a squirrel might have run on the tops of the trees from\r\n     Gurnard to Carisbrooke, and in several other parts for leagues\r\n     together.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn ZOOLOGY there is nothing very remarkable, except the absence of\r\npole-cats, badgers, and till lately, even foxes: but the\r\npoultry-breeders are now indebted for the introduction of the latter to\r\nsome sparkish amateurs of hunting: many have been killed, but they are\r\nstill breeding rapidly in the favorable fastnesses of the more rocky and\r\nwoody districts. Otters too are frequently seen.--GAME is abundant,\r\nparticular attention having been paid to its preservation. \"The great\r\nplenty of hares and other game is owing to the care of Sir Edward\r\nHorsey, governor in 1582, who is reported to have given a lamb for every\r\nliving hare brought to him from the neighbouring counties.\"\r\n\r\nTHE NIGHTINGALE.--These much-prized birds of passage make the island\r\ntheir early and most favorite resort; and to those visitors from the\r\nnorth who perhaps never heard their unrivaled notes, the opportunity\r\nwould prove not the least gratifying circumstance in a day\u0027s pleasure.\r\nOn fine evenings in the months of May and June, the woods and groves in\r\nevery direction resound with the delightful chorus of their inimitable\r\nsongs.\r\n\r\nAstonishing numbers of sea-fowl resort during the summer months to the\r\ncliff\u0027s of Freshwater and Bembridge: in the latter, the eagle has been\r\nknown to build its eyry, and in the time of queen Elizabeth they were\r\nfamous for a breed of hawks, which were so valued, that it was made a\r\ncapital crime to steal them.\r\n\r\nFISH of every kind common to the southern coast of England is caught off\r\nthe island, but not in that abundance which might be expected, except\r\ncrabs and lobsters, which are uncommonly large and fine. Mackarel are\r\nsome seasons extremely plentiful, small, but peculiarly sweet. Numbers\r\nof porpoises are seen rolling along in the Solent Sea and Southampton\r\nWater; sharks are frequently observed off the back of the island, and\r\nsometimes even the grampus pursuing its prey. In 1814, a large whale was\r\ntaken off the Shingles (west of the Needle Rocks,) having been left\r\naground by the ebbing tide: and in the winter of 1841, another,\r\nmeasuring 75 feet in length, was caught near the same spot.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Local Biography and History._\r\n\r\nThe following are amongst the most eminent natives of the island:\r\n\r\n     Sir JOHN CHEEKE, Knt., one of the most distinguished scholars and\r\n     virtuous men of his time: he was tutor to Edward VI, and a zealous\r\n     protestant, but being induced during the following reign to make a\r\n     public recantation, his death, which happened soon after, was\r\n     supposed to have been hastened by shame of that humiliating\r\n     exhibition.\r\n\r\n     Rev. HENRY COLE, D.D., Dean of St. Paul\u0027s, a contemporary of the\r\n     above, was born at Godshill: he shone in divinity and literature,\r\n     and was a strenuous advocate of the Roman-catholic faith.\r\n\r\n     THOs. JAMES, D.D., a learned divine and antiquary: was esteemed,\r\n     from his extensive erudition, a living library, Born at Newport,\r\n     died 1629.\r\n\r\n     ROBERT HOOK, M.D., celebrated for his extraordinary inventive\r\n     powers in almost every branch of art and science, was born at\r\n     Freshwater anno 1635, and died at an advanced age, in Gresham\r\n     College.\r\n\r\n     JOHN HOBSON, rose by his skill and courage from the obscurity of a\r\n     tailor\u0027s parish-apprentice to an admiral\u0027s rank in the reign of\r\n     Queen Anne: he headed Sir George Rooke\u0027s squadron in the attack on\r\n     Vigo harbour, where a numerous Spanish fleet was entirely captured\r\n     or burned.--The little village of Bonchurch claims the honor of his\r\n     birth-place.\r\n\r\nWe shall conclude this general chapter with a brief summary of the\r\nlocal history, though the annals of a small dependent isle like this,\r\ncannot be expected to possess any very exciting interest.\r\n\r\n     [In fact it can boast of no important ancient settlements or\r\n     records--no valued chronicles of the alternate successes and\r\n     defeats of ambitious rival princes and their contending armies, or\r\n     the unpitied sufferings of the sacrificed population: and perhaps\r\n     it would never have been mentioned in the national history, had it\r\n     not been for the imprisonment of fallen royalty in the case of\r\n     Charles I. Its situation certainly exposed it to the attacks of\r\n     Danish pirates, and subsequently of the French; but these distant\r\n     events constituting but a broken and unconnected narrative, the\r\n     ensuing brief sketch will we presume be sufficient for the majority\r\n     of our readers. We refer those who wish further information on the\r\n     subject to the valuable work of Sir Richard Worsley,--from which\r\n     this article is partly abridged.]\r\n\r\n     It was subdued by the Roman troops under Vespasian, A.D. 43; but\r\n     the conquerors could not have experienced much resistance from the\r\n     natives, as no remains of their military works have been here\r\n     discovered. Under the empire, the island was reckoned to contain\r\n     about 1200 families.\r\n\r\n     The Saxon kings of the South of England several times attacked the\r\n     island with their accustomed unsparing ferocity: particularly\r\n     Cerdic, in 530, who replaced the slaughtered British by a colony of\r\n     his own countrymen; and Ceadwalla of Murcia, who having seized it\r\n     in 686, was so incensed at the idolatry of the inhabitants, that he\r\n     resolved at first to extirpate them, and repeople the island with\r\n     _Christians!_ but at the intercession of bishop Wilfred, great\r\n     numbers saved their lives by submitting to be baptized.\r\n\r\n     In the ninth and following centuries the island suffered, in common\r\n     with the neighbouring coast, from the predatory visits of the\r\n     Danes. For a time indeed they were checked by the great Alfred, who\r\n     wholly captured or destroyed one large fleet, laden with the spoils\r\n     of Hampshire and the Wight: but under the weak and disordered\r\n     reigns of his successors, the northern pirates seem to have taken\r\n     possession of this defenceless spot as often as they pleased; and\r\n     after making it a depot for the plunder of the adjacent counties,\r\n     and living freely on the inhabitants, sometimes wantonly burned\r\n     towns and villages at their departure.\r\n\r\n     The island was also severely harrassed by some of the rebellious\r\n     Saxon nobles in the reign of Edward the Confessor; but after the\r\n     Norman Conquest, its tranquillity was not materially disturbed till\r\n     the year 1346, when a party of French landed at St. Helen\u0027s; they\r\n     were soon repulsed by the islanders, though the warden, Sir\r\n     Theobald Russell, was amongst the slain. About this time a variety\r\n     of excellent regulations were made by the inhabitants for their\r\n     better security: the landholders were by their tenures bound to\r\n     defend the castle of Carisbrooke for 40 days at their own charges;\r\n     the county of Devon sent for its defence 76 men-at arms, and the\r\n     city of London 300 slingers and bowmen.\r\n\r\n     Another party of the French seem to have made a more successful\r\n     attack in the first year of Richard II: indeed the islanders at\r\n     that time had little besides their own valor to depend on for\r\n     protection; as there were no forts to obstruct an enemy\u0027s landing;\r\n     Carisbrooke Castle standing in the centre of the island, could\r\n     only serve for a partial retreat: and serious ravages might be\r\n     committed ere any assistance arrived from the mainland. This want\r\n     of domestic security so discouraged the natives, that many families\r\n     withdrew, when an order was issued to the wardens to seize the\r\n     lands of all such as refused to return.\r\n\r\n     Not long afterwards a powerful body of Frenchmen landed in the\r\n     island, the militia of which (900 in number,) had been reinforced\r\n     from Southampton and London, in expectation of this hostile visit.\r\n     The invaders were unable to reduce Carisbrooke Castle, which was\r\n     commanded by the governor, Sir H. Tyrrel--and moreover suffered\r\n     considerable loss by an ambuscade at a place near Newport, still\r\n     called Deadman\u0027s Lane; [Footnote: A tumulus where the slain were\r\n     buried, at the south entrance to the town, was exultingly named\r\n     _Noddies\u0027_ Hill--whence the present appellation Nodehill.] yet as\r\n     the houses of the inhabitants lay at their mercy, they were at\r\n     length bought off by the payment of 1000 marks, and a promise that\r\n     no resistance should be offered, if they revisited the island\r\n     within a year.\r\n\r\n     In the reign of Henry IV, the French made two other attacks: on the\r\n     first occasion they were repulsed with loss; and on the second,\r\n     when a large fleet made a threatening demand of a subsidy, the\r\n     islanders were so elated at their past success, that they invited\r\n     the French to land and try their prowess in fair fight, after\r\n     having had sufficient time to rest and refresh themselves: this\r\n     handsome challenge was not however accepted.\r\n\r\n     Owing to its comparatively remote situation, the island escaped\r\n     those calamities which afflicted the rest of the kingdom during the\r\n     bloody disputes of the rival Roses: nor was it engaged with any\r\n     foreign enemy till the year 1488, when the governor, Sir Edward de\r\n     Woodville, having raised a body of about 500 men, passed over to\r\n     the continent in aid of the Duke of Bretagne against the king of\r\n     France. At the battle of St. Aubin the Bretons were routed, and the\r\n     islanders, whom hatred or contempt of the French probably impelled\r\n     to a more obstinate resistance, perished to a man: this unfortunate\r\n     event plunged the whole island into mourning; and in order to\r\n     recruit the diminished population, an act of parliament forbad any\r\n     single inhabitant from holding farms above the annual rent of ten\r\n     marks.\r\n\r\n     On the 18th of July, 1545, a large French fleet appearing off the\r\n     Isle of Wight, the English squadron which lay at Spithead, though\r\n     greatly inferior in force, stood out to meet them: but the\r\n     admiral\u0027s ship _Mary Rose_ sinking with most of her crew, the\r\n     others retreated into the Solent Channel; while the French landed\r\n     several parties of troops, and after some sharp fighting, repulsed\r\n     the islanders who had collected to oppose them; it was next\r\n     proposed in a council of war to fortify and keep possession of the\r\n     island, but this being considered impracticable by any number of\r\n     men that could then be spared from the ships, they proceeded to\r\n     pillage and burn the villages, till the inhabitants, being\r\n     reinforced, attacked and drove them off with the loss of many men,\r\n     and one of their principal officers. King Henry VIII, in order to\r\n     prevent a repetition of such mischievous visits, erected several\r\n     forts and blockhouses for the protection of the coast; and though\r\n     the rapid advance of the British naval power still more effectually\r\n     guarded it from the danger of foreign invasions, the islanders for\r\n     many years afterwards neglected no precautions for their own\r\n     defence: a train of field-pieces was provided among the different\r\n     parishes, and the militia, in 1625, numbered 2000 men.\r\n\r\n     In the division between king Charles I and the parliament, the\r\n     islanders at first manifested some zeal in the royal cause; yet as\r\n     soon as hostilities commenced at Portsmouth, the Newport militia\r\n     expelled the weak garrison of Carisbrooke Castle, which, with the\r\n     other forts, were delivered to the parliamentary troops; and on the\r\n     arrival of the Earl of Pembroke, the gentlemen and principal\r\n     farmers assembled at Cowes, and tendered him their best services.\r\n     The inhabitants having thus taken a decisive step in closing with\r\n     the prevailing power, remained undisturbed spectators of the\r\n     ensuing commotions, till the king injudiciously sought here an\r\n     asylum.\r\n\r\n     On the 12th of November, 1647, Charles, who had just fled from\r\n     Hampton Court, was met at Tichfield by Colonel Hammond, governor of\r\n     the Isle of Wight, who invited him to take up his residence at\r\n     Carisbrooke Castle. The offer was accepted, and for some time the\r\n     royal guest appeared to be quite free and unrestrained in his\r\n     actions and company; but afterwards his liberty was gradually\r\n     abridged, his confidential servants removed, and himself imprisoned\r\n     within the castle; the various unsuccessful attempts that were made\r\n     to effect his escape only serving as a pretext to increase the\r\n     rigor of his confinement. Yet during the subsequent negociations of\r\n     the Treaty of Newport, he was set at large on his parole,--till a\r\n     detachment of the army broke off the negociations by arresting and\r\n     conveying him to Hurst Castle; 30 days before he lost his life at\r\n     Whitehall.\r\n\r\n     As its situation preserved it from scenes of hostility between the\r\n     troops, the island enjoyed a much happier state than any other part\r\n     of the kingdom during the civil war, which caused many families to\r\n     retire hither: a circumstance that for the time rose the farm-rents\r\n     in the proportion of 20 per cent. The subsequent local history\r\n     presents nothing of any interest, with the exception perhaps of the\r\n     powerful armaments which assembled in the neighbourhood during the\r\n     last French war, and the large bodies of military which were in\r\n     consequence here quartered.\r\n\r\n     The absolute lordship of the Isle of Wight was given by William the\r\n     Conqueror to one William Fitz-Osborne (in reward for his services\r\n     at the battle of Hastings), \"to be held by him as freely as he\r\n     himself held the realm of England\"; but in consequence of the\r\n     defection of his descendant, it was resumed by the Crown. Henry I\r\n     granted it to the Earl of Devon, in whose family it long continued,\r\n     till the alienation of it was obtained by Edward I, for a\r\n     comparatively small sum. The last grant was to Edward de Woodville\r\n     in 1485; from which time there have been successively appointed by\r\n     the Crown,--wardens, captains--and governors of the island: but the\r\n     powers attached to the office have gradually declined, and at\r\n     present it is a mere title, unaccompanied by duty or, we believe,\r\n     emolument.--It is an amusing circumstance in the history of this\r\n     little spot, that it had once the high-sounding honor of having a\r\n     _King of its own!_--for the Duke of Warwick was so crowned by the\r\n     hands of Henry VI, in the year 1444,--but it would seem that the\r\n     glory of the name was all which his _Vectis_ Majesty derived from\r\n     his accession.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCarisbrooke, Newport, Cowes, and Ryde.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     As a stranger\u0027s attention is frequently diverted from noticing many\r\n     interesting features of a scene in the hurried moment of his visit,\r\n     an index \u003e\u003e is placed at the head of each section, pointing only to\r\n     the _most remarkable objects_--a peculiarity which, it is presumed,\r\n     will be found extremely useful to those who have little time to\r\n     spare for minute examination or research.\r\n\r\n     Our arrangement of the subjects supposes the reader to start from a\r\n     point nearly central, and pursue his tour of the island in a\r\n     regular progress, without frequently retrograding, or considerably\r\n     deviating either to the right or left.

It is known to have existed for at least fourteen\r\ncenturies, having in that long period been subjected of course to many\r\nmutations. The Saxon chronicles mention it as a place of strength and\r\nimportance in the year 530, when Cerdic subdued the island; and it was\r\nsubsequently rendered almost impregnable, according to the mode of\r\nfortification which prevailed among the Normans, by William\r\nFitz-Osborne, to whom the island was given by the Conqueror. And in the\r\nreign of queen Elizabeth, it received the most substantial repairs and\r\nample additions; when the outer trenches and bastions were formed upon\r\nthe plan of those of Antwerp--circumscribing about 20 acres.\r\n\r\nOn our nearly reaching the top of the hill by the carriage-road, we see\r\nfirst the ancient KEEP, peering above the rest of the ruins; and next,\r\nthe principal and well-guarded entrance to the interior of the fortress.\r\nPassing through an ivied gateway, built in the reign of queen Elizabeth,\r\nas appears by the legible inscription (40 E.R. 1520,) on a shield over\r\nthe arch: we proceed to another gateway in a spacious square building,\r\nwhose angles are strengthened by two noble round towers: this opens into\r\nthe interior area; had several prison rooms, and was armed with a\r\nportcullis: but the whole of it is now in a sad condition,\r\n\r\n    \"Defac\u0027d by time, and tott\u0027ring in decay!\"\r\n\r\nNothing can be more picturesque than the first view of this venerable\r\nscene: the most luxuriant ivy everywhere mantles the grey walls and\r\nmouldering battlements, interspersed with the waving branches of wild\r\nvegetation: and the surrounding terraces are adorned with the opposing\r\ntints of pines and every variety of deciduous trees.\r\n\r\nBeing admitted through the curious old oaken wicket to the inner court,\r\nthe attendant cicerone will lead the visitor to several objects in due\r\nsuccession: the most remarkable are ...\r\n\r\nThe place in which the unfortunate king Charles I was confined (1647),\r\nand his children imprisoned after his death: but the apartments are so\r\ndilapidated that it is next to impossible to decide upon their\r\narrangement: the window however is shown through which he vainly\r\nattempted an escape: this is generally examined with a greater share of\r\ninterest than perhaps any other part of the castle, and is often obliged\r\nto contribute as a relic, some minute portion of its crumbling walls.\r\n\r\nTHE KEEP is certainly the most ancient part of the fortress, having been\r\nbuilt either prior to, or early in the time of the Saxons: and was\r\nrendered an appendage to the more ample fortifications constructed by\r\nthe Normans. It is reached by a flight of 72 stone steps (nine inches\r\neach); was guarded by a portcullis-gate; and provided with a well 310\r\nfeet deep, since partially filled by the falling ruins.\r\n\r\nAt the S.E. angle are the remains of another very ancient tower called\r\nMONTJOY\u0027S: the walls in some places are eighteen feet thick.\r\n\r\nThe WELL-HOUSE is to many persons the most attractive object within the\r\nwalls of the castle,--for should the solemn ruins fail to impress that\r\nsentiment of reflection which proves to others the very zest of their\r\nvisit, they will at least be not a little amused by the apt performance\r\nof a docile ass, whose task it is to draw up water from a well 300 feet\r\ndeep! This office he performs by treading rapidly inside of an immense\r\nwindlass-wheel (15-1/2 feet in diameter,) whereby he gives it the\r\nnecessary rotatory motion. The natural longevity of these patient\r\nlaborers is here exemplified by the instances on record; one done the\r\nduty for above 50 years, another 40, and another nearly 30. To afford\r\nsome idea of the depth of the well, a lighted candle is lowered: and\r\nwater is thrown down from a bucket, which produces quite a startling\r\nnoise,--it will be three or four seconds in falling. For the same\r\npurpose, pins were formerly employed, but these were strictly forbidden,\r\non account of their deleterious tendency on the water.\r\n\r\nThe Chapel, the Governor\u0027s apartments, the Barracks, Powder Magazine,\r\n\u0026c. are also pointed out; but to go over the whole works of this\r\nvenerable monument of antiquity, and give a minute detail of the several\r\nparts usually shown to strangers, would be tedious to the _reader_,\r\nthough doubtless every spot and fragment must be viewed by the _visitor_\r\nwith a lively interest.\r\n\r\nIf a party be not pressed for time, they should go round the outer\r\nterrace, reckoned a mile in circumference, the walk is in some parts\r\nsequestered and most pleasingly solemn, in other points presenting very\r\ncharming views; and altogether calculated to raise our admiration, and\r\ngive a more perfect idea of this beautiful specimen of ancient\r\nfortification.\r\n\r\nThe open space in the outworks, called the Place of Arms, is where the\r\nArchery Club resort during the season for exercise; no spot certainly\r\ncould be more convenient: though by the bye, there is a degree of modish\r\ngaiety on such occasions, which is not altogether in character (at least\r\nto a picturesque eye,) with the solemnity of a scene betraying ...\r\n\r\n    \"The grey and grief-worn aspect of old days!\"\r\n\r\n     The military establishment of the castle is at present altogether a\r\n     sinecure; formerly this was the regular seat of the insular\r\n     government; but now it is quite deserted, save by the individual\r\n     who has the privilege of showing the place to strangers, and his\r\n     attendants.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE VILLAGE OF CARISBROOKE\r\n\r\nIs an extremely pretty place, and still very populous, though much less\r\nso than formerly, when it enjoyed the consequence of a CITY, guarded by\r\nthe only fortress in the island to which the inhabitants could fly for\r\nrefuge in the moment of invasion: it rises on a hill opposite that on\r\nwhich stand the venerable ruins of the Castle: and in the intervening\r\nvalley a beautiful stream winds its course towards Newport, sufficiently\r\ncopious to turn several mills--the springs supplying water highly\r\nesteemed for its purity. The church is of great antiquity: and its tower\r\nis a very handsome specimen of Gothic architecture, proudly relieving\r\nitself from the surrounding trees and habitations. There are several\r\ngenteel residences, and a few good lodging-houses in the village, whose\r\nneatly dressed gardens, interspersed with lofty trees, and environed by\r\nthe most agreeable scenery, give to the place altogether an uncommon air\r\nof rural beauty.\r\n\r\n      \"How picturesque the view, where up the side\r\n    Of that steep hill, the roofs of russet thatch\r\n    Rise mix\u0027d with trees, above whose swelling tops\r\n    Ascends the tall church-tower, and loftier still\r\n    The hill\u0027s extended ridge, crown\u0027d with yellow corn--\r\n    While slow beneath the bank, the silver stream\r\n    Glides by the flowery isles and willow groves.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWPORT.\r\n\r\n\u003e\u003e_To form an idea merely of the Town, it will be sufficient for a\r\nstranger to pace two or three of the principal streets--the High-st. of\r\ncourse from one end to the other; he will then see the_ TOWN-HALL: _the\r\nold_ PARISH-CHURCH, _situated in the Corn-market; the public_ LIBRARY\r\n_in the Beast-market; and the ancient_ GRAMMAR-SCHOOL. _The most\r\ninviting short walks are over_ MONTJOY\u0027S _to Carisbrooke_--_to the top\r\nof_ PAN DOWN--_and to Hurststake, on the banks of the_ RIVER, _at high\r\ntide_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNEWPORT is allowed by most travellers to be as clean and pretty a\r\ncountry-town as any in the kingdom. The houses are of a modern and\r\nrespectable construction: the streets regular and well paved, with\r\nsufficient descent to be always clean; and two copious streams water it\r\non the east and west.\r\n\r\nBeing closely surrounded by an amphitheatre of lofty downs, beautifully\r\nchecquered by pasture and cultivation, cottages and villas,--the\r\nenvirons are of the most agreeable and inviting character, and the\r\nclimate mild and salubrious; to those therefore who love to blend social\r\nintercourse with the pleasures of a cheerful yet quiet retreat, Newport\r\npresents many decided attractions. Years ago it was observed, that\r\n\"there were few provincial towns which could afford independence more\r\nsources of rational enjoyment:\" and since then there has been a great\r\naccession to the local means of intellectual pleasure, in respect of\r\nphilosophical and literary institutions, private and professional\r\nreading societies, a Mechanics\u0027 Institution, circulating libraries, \u0026c.\r\n\u0026c. The places of public worship too have equally increased; being three\r\nepiscopal (two of recent erection), two for Independents, two for\r\nWesleyan and Primitive Methodists, a Bible-Christian, a Roman-catholic,\r\na Unitarian, and a Particular-baptist. There are five respectable inns,\r\nin the town (see the List), and two assembly-rooms.\r\n\r\nFrom its central position, it is well calculated for being the principal\r\nmarket-town, and, as it were the metropolis, of the island. On the\r\nSaturdays in particular, it presents a very animated scene: being\r\nfrequented by all classes who are obliged to attend for the purposes of\r\nbusiness, or upon judicial affairs; which would naturally induce many\r\nother parties to visit in favorable weather, were it only for the sake\r\nof a pleasant jaunt.\r\n\r\nThese advantages of course give it a steady trade in almost every branch\r\nof business; and latterly the shops have exchanged much of their\r\nantiquated country appearance for the more imposing style of the\r\nfashionable towns,--where dazzling glare is resorted to as the chief\r\nattraction.\r\n\r\n     Though Newport does not depend, like the watering-places, upon the\r\n     annual influx of visitors engaging their lodgings for a season, yet\r\n     many of the best situated and most convenient houses are handsomely\r\n     fitted-up for the purpose; and should the river be ever\r\n     sufficiently deepened to admit a passage steamer to ply at regular\r\n     hours without regard to the state of the tide, Newport might defy\r\n     all competition, by the rapid improvement of its various local\r\n     capabilities which would necessarily follow.\r\n\r\nThe River (called the Medina, from dividing the island in the middle,)\r\nis navigable from Newport to Cowes for vessels of sixty or seventy tons\r\nburthen, during high water. The banks are beautifully dressed with\r\nscattered groves and copse-wood: and interspersed with the arable fields\r\nand meadows are several churches, seats, villas, farms, and cottages, on\r\neither side: and as the lands rise rather boldly, the while scene is\r\nviewed to advantage from the water, and will be found to afford a very\r\ndelightful trip on a summer\u0027s day, to or from Cowes; the party leaving\r\nby the returning tide after about two hours\u0027 stay at either place.\r\n\r\n     The gayest season at Newport is during the Whitsuntide Fair, and\r\n     three successive Saturdays at Michaelmas, the time when the\r\n     agricultural servants receive their wages, and re-engage for the\r\n     following year. The old custom of the female-servants assembling at\r\n     one part of the town, and the men at another, for the purpose of\r\n     engaging in new situations, is still partially kept up; these\r\n     occasions are familiarly called the \"Bargain-fair Saturdays,\" the\r\n     middle or principal one falling on the first Saturday in October.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC BUILDINGS.\r\n\r\nOf these the most conspicuous is the GUILDHALL, situated nearly in the\r\ncentre of the town: it is rather a stately edifice of the Ionic order.\r\nHere the magistrates of the whole island meet every Saturday for\r\nhearing and deciding upon petty causes: and examining and committing\r\nprisoners to the Winchester assizes, or in, minor offences to take their\r\ntrials at the quarter sessions for the Isle of Wight, formerly held at\r\nWinchester, but which are _now_ very properly _adjourned_, to save the\r\ninhabitants the great inconvenience and expense of crossing the water.\r\nThere are also the quarter sessions for the borough; and that excellent\r\ninstitution, the County Court for the settlement of small debts.--In the\r\narea beneath the hall is held the Saturday\u0027s market for poultry, eggs,\r\nand butter.\r\n\r\nAnother showy building is the ISLE OF WIGHT INSTITUTION, or permanent\r\npublic Library, to which nearly all the neighbouring gentry subscribe.\r\nBesides the reading-room and library it contains a museum for local\r\ncuriosities, \u0026c. Temporary residents in the island may become\r\nsubscribers for six months by a payment of 25s.\r\n\r\nThe FREE-GRAMMAR SCHOOL is the only building claiming respect for its\r\nantiquity (besides the parish-church), situated in the street leading to\r\nthe Cowes road: it was erected by subscription in the year 1619, and\r\nduly endowed. Though recently having been repaired throughout, its\r\nappearance is still rather picturesque: and possesses considerable\r\nhistoric interest, from the memorable conference held here between the\r\nparliamentary commissioners and king Charles the First, up to the\r\nunfortunate moment when he was unexpectedly seized and imprisoned in\r\nHurst Castle.\r\n\r\nThe PARISH-CHURCH is considered to be of the age of Henry II, as it is\r\ndedicated to St. Thomas-a-Becket: it is spacious, and has a fine lofty\r\nsquare tower; but there is nothing very particular either in its\r\narchitecture or antiquities to call for minute description. The chief\r\ncuriosities are ... the Pulpit, remarkable for its rich and ingenious\r\ncarving: a monument to Sir Edward Horsey; and the spot where the second\r\ndaughter of King Charles was buried: she died while the family were\r\nprisoners at Carisbrooke--and it was only by accident in the year 1793\r\nthat the vault was discovered.--ST. JOHN\u0027S CHURCH, built a few years\r\nago on the south side of the town, at the foot of Montjoy\u0027s, is a\r\nconspicuous object in most points of view: and though plain in\r\nappearance, is very convenient in its interior arrangements: it is\r\nsupported on the voluntary principle.\r\n\r\nNewport returns two members to parliament.--The number of inhabitants in\r\nthe town, which has considerably extended beyond the limits of the\r\nborough, is about 7000. The corporate body consists of 24 members; but\r\nsince the passing of the Municipal Reform Act, there can of course be\r\nnothing peculiar in their constitution of which the reader need be\r\ninformed.\r\n\r\n     A Lace-factory on a very extensive scale is established just\r\n     without the town, on the east side, going to Ryde: in the town is\r\n     also an establishment which gives employment to many females in the\r\n     lace-embroidering process.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Environs of Newport_.\r\n\r\nThe following villages and hamlets are nearly connected with, or\r\ngradually approximating the town:--\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side, surrounded by meadows, is BARTON\u0027s VILLAGE, near\r\nwhich a neat little church has lately been opened, on the road to\r\nRyde;--just above it is a gentleman\u0027s seat called BELLECROFT.\r\n\r\nSHIDE, half a mile to the south, is picturesquely seated at the foot of\r\nthe steep and high down called Pan: the river Medina flows through the\r\ngrounds, and there are several respectable villas in its immediate\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nWestward is the NEW VILLAGE, a street of genteel and comfortable houses\r\n(some of which are furnished for lodgings,) leading to Carisbrooke:\r\nbehind it is the hill called Montjoy\u0027s, from whose lofty summit is\r\nobtained the most comprehensive view of Newport, its river, and the\r\nadjacent country. There is also a small hamlet on HUNNY-HILL, north of\r\nthe town.\r\n\r\nFAIRLEE is a principal seat, a mile north of Newport. The house is large\r\nand of respectable appearance: standing at the head of an extensive and\r\nbeautiful lawn which slopes to the eastern bank of the river, surrounded\r\nby close and open groves.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile from Newport, on the road to West Cowes, stands the HOUSE\r\nOF INDUSTRY, a very large building, generally containing between 500 and\r\n600 paupers; it includes within its walls a lunatic asylum, hospital,\r\nschool, and chapel: and has an extensive garden attached.\r\n\r\n     Its internal affairs and out-door relief are regulated by a Board\r\n     of Guardians and Directors, consisting of a certain number of\r\n     respectable inhabitants, chosen from every parish in the\r\n     island,--under the provisions of an Act of Parliament obtained in\r\n     the year 1770 for the parochial consolidation of the whole island.\r\n     They are therefore independent of the Poor-law Commissioners, and\r\n     have adopted only as much as they thought proper of the general\r\n     statute.\r\n\r\nALBANY BARRACKS, on the opposite side of the road, are capable of\r\naccommodating nearly 2000 troops--for a long time however the complement\r\nstationed here seldom exceeded a few companies, and for months together\r\nthere would not be even a serjeant\u0027s guard: but latterly the depots of\r\nseveral regiments have been removed hither: so that there are now often\r\nfrom 1000 to 1500 men at the same time.\r\n\r\nWestward of the Barracks, bordering the Yarmouth road, is the extensive\r\ntract called PARKHURST FOREST, planted a few years since with oaks and\r\nScotch firs, by order of Government.\r\n\r\nPARKHURST PRISON, to the north of the barracks, is an extensive range of\r\nbuildings, dedicated to the benevolent purpose of reclaiming from\r\ninfamy, if possible, a large number of juvenile criminals of the male\r\nsex.\r\n\r\n     To accomplish this truly desirable object (as _punishment_ ought\r\n     certainly to be _corrective_ in the best sense of the word), the\r\n     boys are regularly instructed by competent tradesmen, in such\r\n     branches of popular business as may be best suited to their\r\n     respective capacities: in conjunction with the most approved course\r\n     of common school-education. Particular attention is likewise paid\r\n     to the elevation of their moral character, so likely to be\r\n     permanently influenced by means of impressive friendly admonition,\r\n     the frequent inculcation and daily observance of religious duties,\r\n     and the exciting hope of reward for good behaviour in a mitigation\r\n     of their sentence: in short, by the most encouraging and kind\r\n     treatment, as far as is compatible with the strictness of prison\r\n     discipline. None therefore, but the thoroughly incorrigible, can\r\n     leave the institution without being greatly improved in their\r\n     habits and dispositions, if not altogether reformed; since _Order,\r\n     Cleanliness, Activity_, and _Industry_, must become almost natural\r\n     to them by the time they are discharged,--their understandings\r\n     cultivated, and their minds more or less impressed with the\r\n     sentiments of virtue and religion.\r\n\r\n     It would be injudicious to enter in detail on the subject of the\r\n     routine management, or the particular discipline adopted in the\r\n     respective wards: as very probably many alterations will be\r\n     introduced from time to time, as experiment and practice may\r\n     suggest: and moreover, as a \"Report\" is annually published by order\r\n     of Government (at a low price), containing the most minute\r\n     particulars in every department of the Asylum. For the same reasons\r\n     we have avoided any description of the architectural plan of the\r\n     prison, a pretty good idea of which may be formed in passing by on\r\n     the high-road.--We must however mention one fact that speaks highly\r\n     favorably of the salutary system adopted, namely, that during the\r\n     five years from the opening of the institution in 1838, there\r\n     occurred but two deaths among the boys, though the number averaged\r\n     about 250 at the same time.\r\n\r\n     The establishment has been visited by several eminent persons, who,\r\n     after having particularly examined the course adopted in every\r\n     department, expressed themselves so well pleased with its\r\n     management and beneficial tendency, that another building at a\r\n     short distance was erected in 1843; and altogether there is\r\n     sufficient room now for 700 or 800 delinquents. No stranger is\r\n     admitted without an order from the Home Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nThe newly erected residences of the officers and other parties connected\r\nwith the prison, barracks, \u0026c., altogether form quite a village, known\r\nby the general term of Parkhurst.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWEST COWES.\r\n\r\n\u003e\u003e_The transient visitor here should immediately inquire\r\nfor the_ PARADE--_pass by the_ CASTLE _on the beach, to the\r\nbathing-machines_--_retrograde by the carriage-road under the_ NEW\r\nCHURCH--_mount the hill at the back of the Castle_--_reach the_ OLD\r\nCHURCH, _which is contiguous to_ NORTHWOOD PARK--_and then return, to\r\ncross over to E. Cowes_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe decided advantages of Cowes are ... its excellent shore for\r\nbathing--and its safe and commodious harbour--which recommend it\r\nstrongly as a fashionable watering-place, and the resort of gentlemen\r\nfond of aquatic amusements.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of this town from the water, particularly when approached\r\nby the passage from Southampton, is extremely pleasing; as the acclivity\r\nof the hill on which it stands is sufficiently bold to admit of the\r\nhouses being seen above each other, as if built on a succession of\r\nterraces, while their starting formality is charmingly relieved by the\r\nintervening shrubberies and groups of lofty trees. To a stranger\r\nhowever, who may confine his walk to the streets just where he lands,\r\nthis favorable impression would be almost obliterated,--for they are\r\nboth narrow and crowded: though in these respects there is some\r\nimprovement the further he goes either to the east or the west; but it\r\nis near the Castle that he must look for the greatest share of united\r\nbeauty and respectability. The truth is, the lower part near the quay is\r\nof course occupied by tradesmen, for the advantages of business, and\r\nconvenient landing-places; and as their houses stand at the edge of the\r\nwater, many parties prefer their lodgings to those in the more open\r\nquarters on the top of the hill,--and many of them are therefore\r\nelegantly furnished for letting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE PARADE affords a delightful promenade, being on the water\u0027s edge.\r\nHere are several first-rate houses, standing at the foot of the steepest\r\npart of the hill, which is luxuriantly clothed with hanging shrubberies\r\nand several groups of majestic trees, presenting a perfectly unique\r\npicture of sylvan and marine beauty. The Royal Yacht-Club House, with\r\nits ample awning, and the very elegant Gothic villa of Sir John\r\nHippesley, will be particularly noticed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CASTLE, WEST COWES, ISLE OF WIGHT]\r\n\r\nTHE CASTLE stands westward of the Parade: but were it not for a small\r\nbattery of eleven guns in front, the stranger might search in vain for a\r\nfabric which he could identify as \"a Castle,\" at least by any portion of\r\nits modernized architecture and surrounding embellishments. In fact, the\r\noriginal dwelling was a few years ago greatly enlarged--made a story\r\nhigher--the open ground at the back inclosed (!)--with other alterations\r\nto render it a fit residence for nobility. It was built by king Henry\r\nVIII, about the same time as those at Sandown, Yarmouth, and Calshot,\r\nfor the purpose of securing the coast against the then frequent attacks\r\nof pirates, as well as the more formidable invasions of the French.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Castle are the bathing-machines; the villas of Earl Belfast\r\nand Lord Grantham; and behind these several others built in various\r\ntasty styles, and acquiring a picturesque effect from being more or less\r\nscreened by the copse-wood on the steep slope at their back. But the\r\nchief ornament of this quarter is the new Episcopal chapel, whether\r\nviewed near, or from a distance on the water,--being a chastely-elegant\r\nstructure in the Gothic style, in a most commanding situation: it is\r\nprivate property. Should the stranger feel disposed to extend his walk\r\nfor about a mile further on the beach, which he would find very\r\nagreeable--he will come to a gentleman\u0027s residence distinguished by an\r\nair of antiquity, named Westcliff, though the neighbourhood is popularly\r\ncalled EGYPT.\r\n\r\n     We make this remark, because there is a lane close by, which turns\r\n     up to the high-road from Cowes to Gurnard Bay, and by this road we\r\n     would recommend the visitor by all means to return, for the sake of\r\n     the magnificent prospect which it affords, and on the peculiar\r\n     character of which the _permanent_ attractions of the place so much\r\n     depend. But to do this justice, the reader must have recourse to\r\n     his Map. The most prominent objects are Calshot Castle, standing\r\n     apparently isolated at the mouth of Southampton Water, and the tall\r\n     tower of Eaglehurst, seated on the neighbouring shore.\r\n\r\n     By \"permanent attractions,\" we mean, that many landscapes of the\r\n     most romantic character fail to attract our attention for any\r\n     considerable time, on _repeated_ visits, if destitute of those\r\n     ever-varying circumstances which have in some degree the interest\r\n     of NOVELTY such for instance as the rural, and more particularly\r\n     the _marine_ prospects of the Isle of Wight; these afford an\r\n     endless source of amusement to the speculative eye,--whether\r\n     directed to the soft and gradual changes on the variegated face of\r\n     Nature _under cultivation_, or to the more animated, and constantly\r\n     shifting scene exhibited in a crowded sea-port, or where there are\r\n     other safe and ample roadsteds for the heaviest ships of war. In\r\n     these advantages Cowes and Ryde stand pre-eminent.\r\n\r\n    \"Scenes must he beautiful, which daily viewed,\r\n    Please daily, and whose novelty survives\r\n    Long knowledge, and the scrutiny of years--\r\n    Praise justly due to those that I describe\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are now supposed to have reached the top of the hill, where the old\r\nCHURCH is situated: this is a spacious, plain building, having a very\r\ntall square tower, as destitute of beauty as anything of the kind can\r\nwell be: yet as it peers loftily above all the surrounding objects, is a\r\ngreat improvement to the outline of the hill, when viewed from any\r\nconsiderable distance. Contiguous to the crowded cemetery stands ...\r\n\r\nNORTHWOOD HOUSE, a large and elegant mansion in the Palladian style of\r\narchitecture. The PARK is an extensive demesne, and profusely planted;\r\nthere are however comparatively few of those venerable sylvan honors\r\nwhich constitute the beauty of park-scenery.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern slope of the hill, where the high-road turns off for\r\nNewport, stands WESTHILL, a charming cottage-ornee in the centre of a\r\nsmooth sloping lawn interspersed with magnificent elms and close\r\nshrubberies.--In the environs of Cowes are several other genteel\r\nresidences: MOOR-HOUSE is distinguished by its Gothic pinnacles and\r\ncommanding station: and near Gurnard Bay is a pretty retired seat,\r\nappropriately called WOOD-VALE.\r\n\r\nBesides the two churches, there are Catholic, Independent, and Wesleyan\r\nchapels. There are three large Hotels (see the List), and several minor\r\nplaces of good accommodation; reading-rooms, a Mechanics\u0027 Institution,\r\n\u0026c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEAST COWES.\r\n\r\n\u003e\u003e _The town itself has nothing to interest a stranger: but in the\r\nvicinity are several first-rate seats and marine villas--the most\r\ndistinguished being_ OSBORNE, NORRIS, _and_ EAST COWES CASTLE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis little town is separated from West Cowes by the river Medina, which\r\nhere joins the sea. From the unexpected concurrence of various favorable\r\ncircumstances, it is looking-up to be a place of some importance: the\r\nvalue of property has already considerably advanced, and trade in\r\ngeneral improved. It has one good Hotel, several respectable\r\nlodging-houses: a neat episcopalian church, and an Independent chapel.\r\nHaving a large shipwright\u0027s yard, and a number of marine stores, wharfs,\r\n\u0026c., where merchant-ships lie alongside to take in or unload their\r\ncargoes, it often exhibits much of the bustling appearance of a sea-port\r\ntown. There is a private landing-place near the ferry, for the\r\naccommodation of Her Majesty. The Custom-house has been removed to the\r\nother side of the harbour.\r\n\r\nThe immediate neighbourhood of East Cowes has long been extremely\r\nbeautiful, from being almost entirely covered with charming seats and\r\nvillas, whose luxuriant groves and shrubberies give the scenery an\r\nuncommonly rich effect: and her Majesty having made this part of the\r\nisland her marine residence, it now possesses a proud distinction in\r\npoint of interest with the British public.\r\n\r\nA stranger should make his perambulation by first ascending the hill by\r\nthe _old_ carriage-road, passing several villas (see list) secluded by\r\ndense shrubberies and large trees; a circumstance little to be\r\nregretted, as their chief boast is the amenity of their location. But\r\nthrough the tall plantations on the right our eye will be delightfully\r\nattracted by the picturesque turrets of East Cowes Castle, and the\r\nsurrounding beautiful grounds. At the pretty lodge-entrance to the\r\ncastle, the road divides,--the left-hand branch running to Norris, the\r\nright to Osborne and Newport; and in about eight or ten minutes\u0027 further\r\nwalk, we can return by the new road through \"East Cowes Park.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OSBORNE, ISLE OF WIGHT]\r\n\r\n_The Principal Seats near East Cowes._\r\n\r\nOSBORNE, the property of HER MOST GRACIOUS MAJESTY, is entitled, equally\r\nfrom public interest and its own importance, to the first notice under\r\nthis head.--The situation is everyway eligible for the _marine_\r\nresidence of a sovereign of the British Isles: for it commands a most\r\nextensive and _animated_ prospect, including Spithead and other naval\r\nstations: has a beautiful sea-beach (with a private landing-place); and\r\nis sheltered by extensive woods and plantations. The original seat was a\r\nplain family mansion surrounded by park-like grounds, which have been\r\nextended by the purchase of several farms--including BARTON (whose fine\r\nold Elizabethan manor-house has received a complete and judicious\r\nreparation): so that the estate is now most conveniently bounded on the\r\nwest by the high-road from East Cowes to Newport; on the south by a\r\nbranch of the same road to Ryde; on the east by a sheltered cove called\r\nKing\u0027s Quay (as tradition will have it from the circumstance of King\r\nJohn there concealing himself for a time when opposed by the barons):\r\nand on the north-east by the beautiful Solent Channel. Thus compassed by\r\nthe sea and the best roads in the island, it extends from north to south\r\nabout two miles and a half, by nearly two miles from east to west;\r\nenjoying the most delightful variety of scenery, from the simple picture\r\nof rural life to the grandeur of our NAVAL GLORY, and the majesty of the\r\nocean itself.\r\n\r\n     The quality of the soil differs very considerably; but the worst is\r\n     well adapted for oak-plantations; and the thorough draining and\r\n     other improvements now carrying on will make the whole admirably\r\n     suited for agricultural pursuits, to which H.R.H. the Prince\r\n     Consort is very partial. A great part of the estate is enclosed by\r\n     a park-fence; and through the luxuriant woods and undulating\r\n     grounds, several miles of excellent private carriage-roads have\r\n     been constructed, much more being in progress.\r\n\r\nThe PALACE occupies the site of the old house; it is in the Palladian\r\nstyle (which so admirably admits the application to domestic\r\narchitecture of the most beautiful features of the Grecian orders).\r\nWithin the ballustrade of its lofty flat roof is a charming promenade in\r\nfine weather.\r\n\r\nThe flag-tower is 107 feet in height, the clock-tower 90, the first\r\nterrace-wall 17, and the second 10. The Royal Apartments are contained\r\nin the loftiest part of the building--they are handsome and spacious,\r\nand standing altogether in advance, command on every side the most\r\nuninterrupted views: at the back is the flag-tower, communicating with\r\nan open corridor which extends the whole of the north-west face of the\r\nbuilding; and on the other side of the tower is the carriage-entrance,\r\nopening on pleasure-grounds adorned with the choicest varieties of\r\nornamental shrubs--thriving with a luxuriance which promises well for\r\nthe appearance of the estate, when the whole shall have been finished.\r\nThe builder is T. Cubitt, esq.; but the design, we believe, was\r\nprincipally furnished by His Royal Highness Prince Albert himself--whose\r\ntaste, and knowledge of the fine arts, well qualify him for the\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\n     As it would be almost impossible to convey by verbal description a\r\n     correct idea of the general appearance of this noble structure, we\r\n     beg to refer our readers to the annexed Engraving--and also to the\r\n     Views of Osborne, recently published in the \"Vectis Scenery,\" and\r\n     which may be purchased separately at 1s. each.\r\n\r\nNORRIS is a noble specimen of the castellated mansion, having been\r\nbuilt in imitation of an ancient Norman fabric--massive in its\r\nconstruction, and remarkable for a stern simplicity of style disdaining\r\nall minute decoration. From this circumstance, and some of the loftiest\r\ntowers being enveloped in the most luxuriant ivy, the whole building has\r\nso venerable an air of antiquity, even when closely examined, that we\r\ncan hardly suppose it to be the production of modern days: and enjoying\r\ntoo as it does an uncommonly fine position on the most northern hill of\r\nthe island, its general aspect is truly magnificent in every point of\r\nview. It is scarcely necessary to add, that the castle commands a most\r\ninteresting marine prospect.\r\n\r\nSome of the rooms are of elegant dimensions, and the arrangement of the\r\nwhole considered good--such indeed might be expected from the reputation\r\nof the architect, the late Mr. Wyatt. The stables, \u0026c., are also on a\r\nvery ample scale, and in the same plain, substantial style as the\r\ncastle, for which they have not unfrequently been taken by strangers at\r\nthe first glance.\r\n\r\nThe grounds are now well timbered: the plantations beautifully dressing\r\nthe steep slope even to the water\u0027s edge. The utmost privacy might be\r\nenjoyed, for there is the accommodation of a good landing-place, and a\r\ncarriage-road thence to the house.\r\n\r\n     Norris was the property of the late Lord Henry Seymour, who was\r\n     engaged many years in its construction, and must in the course of a\r\n     long period have expended immense sums in improvements that may be\r\n     said to be now buried from our view. After his demise, it was two\r\n     seasons chosen for the residence of their R.H. the Duchess of Kent\r\n     and the Princess Victoria (during which time the latter improved\r\n     remarkably in her health): and has since been purchased on very\r\n     moderate terms by R. Bell, esq.--who greatly extended the scope of\r\n     the grounds by fresh purchases of land, especially by some\r\n     belonging to the Osborne estate--previously to her Majesty\u0027s\r\n     negociating for its possession.\r\n\r\nEAST COWES CASTLE, which enjoys a truly enviable site (for it combines\r\nan uncommon degree of shelter with the most extensive and _animated_\r\nprospect), is built in the bold style usually termed the Moorish, and\r\nhas three handsome fronts of varied elevations, with a tasteful\r\ndiversity of towers, mantled more or less by the most luxuriant ivy, and\r\na great variety of elegant flowering plants. The Conservatory is a\r\nsplendid addition; and the grounds, though not extensive, are very\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\n     East Cowes Castle was built by, and continued for many years to be\r\n     the favorite residence of the late John Nash, esq., and was with\r\n     him a sort of architectural pet, receiving from time to time such\r\n     additions and alterations as appeared to be improvements to the\r\n     general design, or called for on the score of enlarged\r\n     accommodation; a circumstance certainly not calculated to insure\r\n     the greatest amount of domestic convenience (as regards the size\r\n     and arrangement of the rooms), though no doubt contributing largely\r\n     to the picturesque effect of the exterior. On Mr. Nash\u0027s demise it\r\n     was purchased by Earl Shannon,--and after his death by N. Barwell,\r\n     esq., who in 1846 sold off all the furniture, and valuable\r\n     productions of art which adorned this beautiful object of interest\r\n     to visitors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\"EAST COWES PARK\"\r\n\r\nIs the title of a very extensive building speculation, which comprehends\r\nabove 100 acres of land, lying between Osborne and East Cowes. This\r\ntract was a few years back laid out for the erection of a number of\r\nelegant villa-residences, each to be surrounded with its garden and\r\nshrubbery, yet to command a delightful marine view. Excellent roads were\r\nmade, having on either side a foot-path, flower-border, and neat iron\r\npallisade; handsome gateways erected; and a pier, botanic garden, and\r\nother attractive improvements commenced or projected. The speculation\r\ndid not however meet the success it merited, and comparatively few\r\nhouses have as yet been built.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HARBOUR,\r\n\r\nTo which Cowes is principally indebted for its origin and present\r\nimportance, enjoys a high character for safety as well as convenience:\r\nit is used by vessels of heavy tonnage, either in waiting for a\r\nfavorable wind, or for the purpose of repairing damages sustained at\r\nsea; and after stormy weather, is often crowded with ships of various\r\nnations, in addition to those registered at the place--this being the\r\nport for the whole island.\r\n\r\nThere are spacious dockyards, patent slips, \u0026c., both at East and West\r\nCowes: at the latter, excellent dry docks. The naval builders have long\r\nheld a high reputation for skill: several men-of-war were built here\r\nduring the last century; and of late years numerous beautiful\r\npleasure-yachts, merchantmen, sloops of war, and other vessels--including\r\nthe _Medina_, a first-rate steam-ship (lost on the West India passage),\r\nand some large steamers for various foreign governments.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     THE ROYAL-YACHT-SQUADRON\r\n\r\n     Make Cowes their port of rendezvous: they contribute largely to the\r\n     maritime gaiety of the place, and give particular classes of\r\n     tradesmen an extensive share of employment; but the town altogether\r\n     does not, it is said, derive that degree of fostering patronage\r\n     from their presence which might be expected. The _Royal Thames\r\n     Yacht-club_ often make this their summer-station.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE REGATTA\r\n\r\n     Generally takes place in August, and is an exciting source of\r\n     hilarity with the inhabitants of Cowes, as well as numerous\r\n     visitors from every part of the island and opposite coast,--should\r\n     the weather prove favorable at the time. The sailing-matches are\r\n     now mostly confined to the members of the Royal Yacht-squadrons:\r\n     and it is to be regretted, that owing to the distance which they\r\n     sail, and the number of days engaged, comparatively little pleasure\r\n     is afforded to the mere spectator: there is however usually one\r\n     day\u0027s continued amusement--when sailing and rowing matches for\r\n     liberal subscription-prizes likewise take place between the local\r\n     watermen, \u0026c.--excellent bands of music attend,--and in the evening\r\n     there is a brilliant display of fire-works, both from the shore and\r\n     from the yachts in various parts of the harbour. On these occasions\r\n     the appearance of the whole is animated beyond description; and to\r\n     a person from the country, the exhibition of such a numerous\r\n     assemblage of the most beautiful vessels in the world must prove a\r\n     lively gratification, for they are of every size and variety of\r\n     rig, from the stately ship of 4 or 500 tons burthen down to the\r\n     yawl of only 10.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Cowes lies extremely convenient for parties fond of aquatic trips:\r\n     for which purpose a number of experienced watermen ply excellent\r\n     boats: they are most frequently engaged in the short and pleasant\r\n     excursions to Beaulieu, Netley, Southampton (on the opposite\r\n     coast), and Newport; sometimes to Alum Bay, and even for a voyage\r\n     round the island.\r\n\r\n     The bathing here is considered very excellent: particularly so at\r\n     W. Cowes, from the boldness and pebbly character of the beach,\r\n     admitting the machines to be put in requisition in all states of\r\n     the tide,--a very great advantage. There are also hot and other\r\n     baths for the use of invalids, both at the machines and at certain\r\n     parts of the town.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Road from East Cowes to Ryde._\r\n\r\nWHIPPINGHAM CHURCH stands near the second mile-stone, on the ascent of a\r\nhill rising from the eastern bank of the Medina: it is perhaps the\r\nneatest _old_ ecclesiastical structure in the island, and is frequently\r\nattended by her Majesty and Prince Albert when residing at Osborne.\r\nClose by are the Parsonages and PADMORE HOUSE, embosomed in groves, and\r\ncommanding an extensive prospect--the nearest object on the opposite\r\nside of the river being the ancient though plain church of Northwood.\r\nAltogether this is a very pleasing rural spot, and to visit it will make\r\nthe difference of only a few minutes in diverging from the regular road.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWOOTTON-BRIDGE.\r\n\r\nHere we pass over an inlet of the sea, indifferently called Fishbourne\r\nCreek or Wootton River; the cottages border the road on either side, and\r\nhave a remarkably clean and comfortable appearance. There are also a few\r\ngood houses: the Parsonage, though rather secluded, enjoys a charming\r\nmarine prospect; and _Kite-hill_ will be known by its antique aspect and\r\nscreen of lofty firs. But the pride of the place is FERNHILL, a\r\nfirst-rate seat: the house is built in the light Gothic style, and\r\nstands at the head of an extensive lawn sloping to the water,\r\ninterspersed with groups of trees and flourishing plantations.\r\n\r\n     We shall often see the prospect-tower of Fernhill peering above the\r\n     masses of variegated foliage; and indeed the whole has much the air\r\n     of a religious structure, enjoying one of those happy localities\r\n     which distinguished such retreats of former days. The opposite\r\n     banks of the river, or rather lake, are clothed with the finest\r\n     oak-woods in the island, feathering from the very water\u0027s edge; and\r\n     the whole neighbourhood presents the rich appearance of an\r\n     extensive forest covering hill and dale. Should therefore the\r\n     visitor reach this spot at the favorable concurrence of high water\r\n     on a calm sunny day, he will agree with us that the whole forms a\r\n     splendid landscape,--_rock_ being in fact the only feature denied\r\n     to make it perfect.\r\n\r\n     Excellent roads have recently been made (by the proprietor of the\r\n     estate,) on the west side of the river, below the bridge: affording\r\n     a very pleasant drive; and as they open many delightful sites, will\r\n     probably cause a considerable accession of buildings in that\r\n     direction.\r\n\r\n     At the mouth of the creek on the east side is a large hamlet called\r\n     FISHHOUSE, including a dockyard, where several frigates have been\r\n     built.\r\n\r\nWOOTTON COMMON is a mile nearer Newport: and affords an instance within\r\na few years of a wild tract of gorse and brambles being profitably\r\nconverted to tillage and garden. Here too are several scattered\r\ndwellings forming an improving hamlet; and in one of them (called in\r\ncourtesy _Landscape Cottage_,) was produced _in all its stages_ the\r\npresent little work, as well as its other kindred publications.\r\n\r\nAbout midway between Wootton and Ryde, on the sea side of the road, we\r\npass the remains of\r\n\r\n\r\nQUARR ABBEY,\r\n\r\nThe most considerable ecclesiastical establishment ever founded in the\r\nIsle of Wight, which had, like every other part of Great Britain,\r\nprevious to the Reformation, its full share of monastic and other\r\nreligious institutions. This was among the first settlements of the\r\nCistercian Order in England, having been built in the 12th century; was\r\nmost amply endowed, and had several illustrious persons buried in the\r\nchapel, to whose memory sumptuous monuments were erected; but after its\r\ndissolution, the property was purchased by a merchant of Southampton,\r\nand the sacred edifice _reduced for the value of the bare materials_.\r\n\r\n     The merchant\u0027s son afterwards sold the estate to the Lord Chief\r\n     Justice, Sir Thomas Fleming, with whose descendants it still\r\n     remains. Some of the outer walls are still extant, and must have\r\n     circumscribed at least 20 acres. A foot-path passes through the\r\n     grounds to Ryde, \u0026c.\r\n\r\n     Of this once-magnificent establishment little now remains; merely\r\n     portions of the appendant offices, which were converted into barns,\r\n     \u0026c., for farm-purposes. What was spared in the moment of ruthless\r\n     spoliation, lay long buried under heaps of rubbish and weeds--till\r\n     a few years since, when one of the occupiers, with laudable zeal,\r\n     rescued from total annihilation the few remaining fragments, which\r\n     are now open to the view of strangers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The other Religious Structures\r\n\r\n     Scattered through the island were ... a Priory at St. Helen\u0027s; one\r\n     at Appuldurcombe; one at St. Cross, near Newport; and another at\r\n     Carisbrooke, vestiges of which may still be traced; together with a\r\n     great number of oratories, chantries, chapels, and religious\r\n     houses, amounting in the whole to 70 or 80, exclusive of the\r\n     regular parish-churches;--and yet scarcely any of these interesting\r\n     monuments have survived their reckless doom to ruin and neglect;\r\n     not even a spiry fragment sufficiently large or romantic to form a\r\n     pleasing subject for the pencil, invite the mind to contemplation,\r\n     or aid the poet\u0027s retrospective muse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBINSTEAD, to which there is a good foot-path from Quarr through the\r\nwoods, is about a mile westward of Ryde. Several genteel residences,\r\nmostly built in a pleasing cottage-style, adorned by groups of trees and\r\nshrubs, are scattered over a wide space of broken ground, where\r\nextensive stone-quarries have been worked for many centuries. It is a\r\nfavorite walk with the inhabitants of Ryde, across the fields to the\r\nchurch (not seen from the road), which has lately been considerably\r\nenlarged and improved. The names of the respective villas will be found\r\nin the List of Seats.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRYDE.\r\n\r\n     \u003e\u003e _The best may of seeing this populous town, by those who have\r\n     little inclination, or perhaps less time, for perambulation is,\r\n     from the Pier, to enquire first for_ BRIGSTOCK TERRACE--_walk on\r\n     for about five minutes still westward--returning, pass by the_\r\n     CHURCH, _and round the_ TOWN-HALL, _and Market-place_, ST. JAMES\u0027S\r\n     CHAPEL, _and the Theatre;--look into the_ ARCADE, _a little\r\n     below;--traverse the street nearly opposite the theatre, which will\r\n     open the eastern part of the town, where there is a handsome_ NEW\r\n     CHURCH--_and the very agreeable Environs in the direction of Appley\r\n     and St. John\u0027s, which ought to be visited if time could be spared,\r\n     going first on the beach, and returning by the high-road, a circuit\r\n     of about two miles._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RYDE, ISLE OF WIGHT.]\r\n\r\nRyde now ranks the first town in the island for the number of its\r\nelegant _modern_ erections, both public and private; and if building\r\nshould be carried on with an equal degree of spirit for a few years\r\nmore, it will also be considerably the most populous. It occupies two\r\nsides of a lofty hill, falling with a regular descent to the sea on the\r\nnorth, opposite Portsmouth, from which it is about five miles across.\r\nThis short passage, from its perfect safety and general convenience,\r\nproves a great local advantage, being performed several times a-day by\r\nsuperior steam-vessels in about half an hour. But besides these\r\nestablished means of conveyance, large-sized wherries (most excellent\r\nsea-boats,) are in constant attendance to take parties across on\r\nmoderate terms, or for hire by the day upon any aquatic trip, even to\r\nBrighton.\r\n\r\nThe town used formerly to be distinguished into Upper and Lower Ryde,\r\nfrom having several fields between, but now it is only the difference of\r\nposition which calls for any term of distinction; for where the green\r\nmeadows then formed the separation, is now the most closely built upon;\r\nand at the beginning of this century, Yelf\u0027s Hotel stood a new and\r\nisolated object.\r\n\r\nThe principal streets are very open, clean, and well-paved; regularly\r\ndisposed, most of them crossing each other nearly at right angles.\r\nSeveral of the handsomest run parallel almost in a direct line to the\r\nbeach, thus affording the very desirable advantage of an interesting\r\nsea-view.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE PIER being the first object to interest a stranger, and having\r\ncontributed more than anything else to the advancement of the town, is\r\nwell entitled to priority of notice.\r\n\r\n     Up to the year 1814, when it was constructed by a company in\r\n     subscription shares of £.50 each, landing or embarking was rendered\r\n     generally a miserable task, except during very favorable weather,\r\n     at the moment of high tide. The practice then was, to cram the\r\n     passengers promiscuously into a common luggage-cart, till it was\r\n     drawn out upon the almost level sands sufficiently far for a large\r\n     wherry to float alongside, into which they were then transferred,\r\n     and conveyed to the sailing-packet, perhaps lying off at some\r\n     considerable distance. The reader will readily believe that this\r\n     united cart and boat process of reaching the vessel or shore could\r\n     not be very inviting at the best of times; but it was really\r\n     terrific to weak and timid persons during the concurrence of a\r\n     heavy rain, and the tide perhaps at its lowest ebb!--to say nothing\r\n     of the horrors of a dark and squally night.\r\n\r\n     The length of the Pier is now nearly half a mile (being double the\r\n     extent it was originally), having had 500 feet added in the year\r\n     1824: the same augmentation again in 1833; and in 1842 it received\r\n     the crowning addition of a most spacious and well constructed HEAD,\r\n     which was rendered everyway more convenient for passengers landing\r\n     or embarking. This last improvement must afford a most delightful\r\n     accommodation for the gentry who prefer the pier for their usual\r\n     promenade; and where, from the great extent it stretches out into\r\n     the open sea, those invalids who are precluded from exercise, may\r\n     more conveniently enjoy the invigorating sea-breeze. It is firmly\r\n     constructed of timber: has four or five landing-places at different\r\n     distances to suit the state of the tide: a strong railing on each\r\n     side; and is furnished with several open and covered seats.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_PRINCIPAL BUILDINGS_.\r\n\r\nThe TOWN-HALL and MARKET-HOUSE affords the best proof of the public\r\nspirit of the inhabitants of Hyde in regard to local improvements: for\r\nthis handsome edifice is on a scale to accommodate three or four times\r\nthe present population. It was first opened in the year 1831: and the\r\ncommissioners for improving the town endeavoured to establish a\r\npermanent market for cattle, \u0026c., to be held in the large open space in\r\nfront, but the attempt proved abortive--Newport lying so much more\r\nconveniently for the general resort of agriculturists and tradesmen from\r\nevery quarter of the island.--It is remarkable, however, considering the\r\nspirit of the inhabitants for public improvements, that it should have\r\nbeen left to the year 1840, before the town was lighted with gas!\r\n\r\nThe ARCADE is an elegant piece of architecture, though it does not make\r\nthat imposing figure of its exterior, which the visitor would expect,\r\nwhen previously told that it cost at least £10,000. It contains 14\r\nshops, and a very large room for the exhibition and sale of works of\r\nart: every portion being finished in the best style of workmanship.\r\n\r\n     This bold undertaking for a private individual, we are sorry to\r\n     say, has not yet realized a remunerating return. The mistake seems\r\n     to have been in fixing upon a site which had no local advantages to\r\n     recommend it for a fashionable promenade; nor likely ever to become\r\n     a much-frequented thoroughfare, popular and busy. Moreover, the\r\n     tradesmen generally find it more to their advantage to engage\r\n     respectable houses in the best streets, where they can profitably\r\n     let lodgings, and make a much more attractive exhibition of their\r\n     goods. These remarks will also serve to explain, why comparatively\r\n     so few persons avail themselves of the extensive accommodation\r\n     which the Market-house affords.\r\n\r\nBRIGSTOCK TERRACE is a fine range of first-rate houses built according\r\nto a very judicious, uniform design, furnished by the late Mr. J.\r\nSanderson. They command a beautiful marine prospect, as they stand at\r\nthe head of a sloping lawn-like field, interspersed with several oaks\r\nand elms: indeed the terrace is the most conspicuous part of Ryde when\r\nviewed from the sea.\r\n\r\nOn the west side of the town too is a very spacious square, comprising a\r\ngreat variety of tastefully-embellished mansions; indeed in every\r\ndirection a number of elegant houses are constructing,--tenants being\r\nfound for most of them even before they are completed.\r\n\r\n     A very few years ago it was quite an easy task to point out by\r\n     distinctive marks all the most important houses--it was only to\r\n     name _Westmont_, and the two unobtrusive villas of the Duke of\r\n     Buckingham and Earl Spencer. The stranger could then have no\r\n     difficulty in discriminating these: but now, to give a List of all\r\n     the residences that are entitled to notice with an equal share of\r\n     pretensions, however judiciously described, would prove perfectly\r\n     futile, and only calculated to mislead the stranger.\r\n\r\nCHURCHES and other public places of divine worship.--These of course\r\nincrease with the population; for only as late as the year 1827, the old\r\nchapel, now distinguished by its graceful spire (and seen at the back of\r\nthe terrace), was so inadequate in its accommodations, as to require\r\nbeing considerably enlarged: and in the same year another was commenced\r\nas a private speculation by Hughes Hughes, esq., this is a long, low\r\nedifice, remarkable for its neat interior: a third has since been\r\nerected on the eastern side of the town, of a handsome design both\r\ninside and out, and very conspicuous from its open situation and lofty\r\nspire:--all three being episcopalian chapels of ease to Newchurch. The\r\nIndependents, Wesleyans, and Primitive-methodists have also their\r\nrespective chapels, and one for Catholic worship has been lately built,\r\nof the most elaborate style of architecture, especially the interior.\r\n\r\nTHE FAMILY HOTELS, INNS, \u0026C.--Of these there are several, of various\r\nranks, some of them vying in splendor and extent of accommodation with\r\nthe best in the county (see the List). The lodging-houses are of course\r\nvery numerous, and in every grade, from the humble _jessamy_ or _myrtle_\r\ncottage at 20 or 30 shillings per week, to the lordly mansion at as many\r\nguineas.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter summer months, the theatre is usually opened by a\r\ntalented company of comedians. The shops are generally very imposingly\r\nfitted-up and well stocked: and in the literary and fancy lines are\r\nseveral excellent establishments--news-rooms, circulating-libraries,\r\nbazaars, \u0026c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Aquatic Amusements, \u0026c. at Ryde._\r\n\r\n     THE ROYAL VICTORIA YACHT-CLUB, established in 1845, numbers amongst\r\n     its members many gentlemen of the highest rank, and owners of as\r\n     fine yachts as any in the world. Their Club-house is a handsome and\r\n     commodious building on the beach west of the Pier; and they have an\r\n     annual Regatta in the latter part of the summer, when several\r\n     pieces of plate, etc., are sailed for by the vessels of this and\r\n     other clubs. There is also a TOWN REGATTA held about the same time,\r\n     for the purpose of giving encouragement to the skilful and\r\n     deserving watermen: the sailing matches being between the wherries\r\n     of the place, which are of a large size, and esteemed by nautical\r\n     men to be the finest sea-boats in the kingdom: and as the race is\r\n     confined to a circuit which can be distinctly seen from the whole\r\n     of the Pier, there is as much interest excited as if the prizes\r\n     were contested between larger craft. Rowing-matches also take\r\n     place; good bands attend--and the diversions of the day usually end\r\n     with a splendid display of fireworks, a dinner, or a ball. In\r\n     short, nothing can exceed the gaiety of the scene, when the weather\r\n     is at all fine: as it is made the occasion of a general festivity\r\n     by the inhabitants--and resorted to as a holiday by great numbers\r\n     from Newport, and the eastern parts of the island.\r\n\r\nTHE SHORE presents, when the tide is at its lowest ebb, a wide expanse\r\nof sand, stretching for miles both eastward and westward of the Pier,\r\npreserving upon an average the breadth of a mile: here and there\r\ninterspersed with ledges of rock, and the banks beautifully feathered\r\nwith groves and shrubberies. In some parts the sand has accumulated over\r\nthe mud in sufficient quantity to bear wheel-carriages (which is the\r\ncase near the Pier): and is found to be gradually increasing both in\r\ndepth and extent. The best time to take a walk upon the shore is\r\ndirectly after the tide has begun to ebb,--for the sand is then firm and\r\ncool to the feet; but after a few hours\u0027 powerful sun in calm weather,\r\nit is rendered sufficiently hot to give the flowing sea almost the\r\ntemperature of a warm bath, on which account the bathing here is\r\npreferred by many parties to a bolder shore.\r\n\r\n     That part called the DUVER (now built on,) was remarkable as having\r\n     been chosen for interring the crew of the Royal George, a ship of\r\n     108 guns, which sank at Spithead on August 29th, 1782, by a sudden\r\n     squall, while undergoing a careening of her bottom, when nearly\r\n     1000 persons perished.\r\n\r\nNear the Pier are the bathing-machines, well attended, and in full\r\noperation; together with hot, tepid, and other baths for invalids.\r\n\r\n     THE PROSPECT.--As the _amenity_ of every situation depends, we\r\n     consider, greatly on the range and beauty of the view which it\r\n     commands, we here give a faint sketch of the one obtained from Ryde\r\n     and its neighbourhood: by which, however imperfect, it will be seen\r\n     by the reader, that few prospects in England can surpass this,\r\n     perhaps even in point of pleasing composition--but certainly not as\r\n     _a perpetual source of the most amusing observation_.\r\n\r\n     The foreground of the Pier generally presents a most animated\r\n     picture,--crowded with promenading fashionables; and surrounded by\r\n     numerous wherries, steam-packets, and other craft, at anchor or\r\n     gaily sailing about; a busy scene which forms a striking contrast\r\n     to the quiet sylvan charms of the home-coast extending many miles\r\n     east and west, and embellished by several delightful villas and\r\n     other marine residences, among which are Osborne Palace (indicated\r\n     by a lofty prospect-tower),--and Norris Castle, just beyond. We\r\n     have the Solent Channel seen from here to peculiar advantage,--on\r\n     the one hand contracting to the appearance of a noble river, and on\r\n     the other expanding and uniting with the open sea. The far-famed\r\n     anchorage of Spithead occupies the centre, with St. Helen\u0027s to the\r\n     eastward, for ships of war; and westward, the Motherbank and\r\n     Stokes\u0027s Bay, for merchantmen and colliers; hourly altering their\r\n     position with the changing tides, and their number as suddenly\r\n     increased or diminished with every adverse or propitious breeze.\r\n\r\n    \"Majestic o\u0027er the sparkling tide,\r\n      See the tall vessel sail,\r\n    With swelling winds, in shadowy pride,\r\n      A swan before the gale!\"\r\n\r\n     The eye is soon caught by a splendid range of houses called\r\n     Anglesea Villa, on the opposite nearest shore, contiguous to\r\n     Monkton Fort; and is thence carried to immense mass of brick\r\n     buildings that form the grand naval hospital of Haslar, with the\r\n     town of Gosport in its rear; opposite which are the celebrated\r\n     fortifications of Portsmouth, with its noble harbour affording calm\r\n     security to the maritime glory of England:--Southsea Castle stands\r\n     a little to the eastward, and beyond that is the low level of\r\n     Hayling Island, where several handsome houses have recently been\r\n     built.\r\n\r\n     The line of Portsdown hills, on one of which is Nelson\u0027s monumental\r\n     pillar, usually bounds the view to the north; but in clear weather\r\n     our range of perspective embraces a portion of the South Downs\r\n     which is crossed by the London road near Petersfield: and on the\r\n     left, the beautiful retiring banks of Southampton Water to the town\r\n     to itself, backed by the woodland heights of the New Forest;--while\r\n     to the right it extends to the spire of Chichester Cathedral; but\r\n     with the aid of a glass even to Beachy-head, which appears in the\r\n     east like a faint cloud upon the horizon of the sea.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE ENVIRONS OF RYDE\r\n\r\nMay be characterized as being beautifully rural, enlivened by peeps or\r\nopen prospects of the sea: for this is the best wooded quarter of the\r\nisland, adorned with several charming seats and villas, and intersected\r\nby good roads.\r\n\r\n     But perhaps it ought to be here explained to the stranger, that by\r\n     _good_ roads, in the Isle of Wight, is only meant that they are\r\n     kept in tolerably good order: not that they are level, or even\r\n     gently undulating: for the very charm of the island consists in its\r\n     sudden alternation of hill and dale, producing a constant change of\r\n     scenery: one moment you may be enclosed in a sylvan theatre; and\r\n     the next minute stand on the brow of a hill, sufficiently lofty to\r\n     command an interminable panoramic prospect of land and sea.\r\n\r\nWe will first conduct our friends along the shore _eastward_ of the\r\ntown, for the distance of two or three miles. The principal objects to\r\nthe westward have been already noticed (p. 41, \u0026c.)\r\n\r\nAPPLEY (about half a mile,) is a marine villa celebrated for its\r\namenity: hence an excellent road to St. John\u0027s, where several very\r\neligible sites for building on are to be disposed of: and a neat little\r\nchurch has recently been erected.\r\n\r\nST. CLARE, another delightful residence: the house built in the\r\ncastellated style: and the pleasure-grounds and very extensive gardens,\r\ntruly exquisite.\r\n\r\nPUCKPOOL, a sequestered Swiss Cottage.\r\n\r\nSPRING-VALE, a pretty hamlet composed of lodging-houses.--A\r\ncarriage-road hence by the back of St. Clare.\r\n\r\nSEA-VIEW (two miles), another pleasant hamlet, containing several\r\nlodging-houses: and having near it the beautiful villas of SEA-FIELD,\r\nFAIRY-HILL, SEA-GROVE, \u0026c. A road hence to Nettlestone Green.\r\n\r\nThe grounds of the Priory extend eastward for about a mile: the sandy\r\nbeach the whole of the distance is remarkably fine.\r\n\r\n     \u003e\u003e _From the above it is apparent, that a Party may have a very\r\n     pleasant saunter just as far as may prove agreeable, according to\r\n     their ability for walking; as there is a choice of roads by which\r\n     to return, thus making a circuit of any extent they like._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now start by the regular carriage-road for the rocky coast (commonly\r\ncalled the Back of the island), and first reach a hamlet on the rise of\r\nthe next hill, named OAK-FIELD, and then ...\r\n\r\nST. JOHN\u0027s, a first-rate seat,--mansion plain, but admirably situated\r\nfor prospect, and screened by beautiful wood, as will appear in the\r\nroad making several sudden turns, over-arched by lofty trees, especially\r\nthe silver fir. Shortly the tower of St. Clare appears on our left:\r\nWESTRIDGE in a valley on the right; and several other minor seats are\r\nsuccessively passed,--some partially seen through the woods and\r\nshrubberies, and others quite secluded.\r\n\r\n     \u003e\u003e From the hamlet called _Nettlestone Green_ (about two miles from\r\n     Ryde,) a carriage-road leads down to Sea-view, by which the party\r\n     may on another occasion return on the beach to Ryde, passing the\r\n     back of St. Clare.\r\n\r\nTHE PRIORY is three miles from Ryde: it takes its name from having been\r\nthe site of an ancient monastic cell--is a spacious, plain mansion, and\r\nranks among the finest seats in the island: here too, much of the wood\r\nis uncommonly fine, notwithstanding its exposure to the sea-air.\r\nArriving at ...\r\n\r\nST. HELEN\u0027s GREEN,\r\n\r\nWe are presented with a beautiful view of the Peninsula of Bembridge,\r\nBrading Haven, and the British Channel. The houses are mostly scattered\r\nround a large verdant square (which gives the name): and a spacious\r\nbuilding, to answer the purposes both of a parish school and chapel, has\r\nbeen lately supplied by the liberality of a resident gentleman. But the\r\nchief object of curiosity here is THE OLD CHURCH-TOWER, _standing now at\r\nthe water\u0027s edge_, and still struggling against the further\r\n\"encroachment of the sea,\" which in the year 1719, was such as to oblige\r\nthe parishioners to build another place of worship in a more secure\r\nsituation: this we passed near the Priory. The old tower was\r\nstrengthened with a thick facing of brick-work, and painted white; for\r\nit was required to be preserved as a landmark to ships entering the\r\nroadsted. There is something extremely tranquil and pleasing in the\r\nwhole of the scene,--and though the composition is simple, forms an\r\nexcellent subject for a sketch.\r\n\r\n     \u003e\u003e The Party may either cross the ferry with their vehicle to\r\n     Bembridge--for there is a good horse-boat in attendance, and drive\r\n     round Yaverland and Brading; or they may go to the latter place at\r\n     once; returning over the downs to Ashey Sea-mark, which affords an\r\n     almost unrivaled prospect,--and hence descend towards Ryde, making\r\n     altogether a charming circuit of about sixteen miles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBRADING HAVEN\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRADING HAVEN, _As viewed from Bembridge Mill looking\r\nacross to the Town of Brading, Nunwell, \u0026c._ ISLE OF WIGHT.]\r\n\r\nExhibits during high water the beautiful appearance of an extensive\r\nlake: but at the recess of the tide, a mere waste of sand and ooze,\r\ncomprehending above 800 acres.\r\n\r\n     As the sea comes through a very narrow inlet at St. Helen\u0027s,\r\n     several unsuccessful attempts have been made to recover from its\r\n     usurpation so valuable a tract of land:--in 1630 the famous Sir H.\r\n     Middleton was engaged, and indeed succeeded for a short time, by\r\n     means of a bank of peculiar construction. But the sea brought up so\r\n     much sand, ooze, and weeds, as to choke up the passage for the\r\n     discharge of the fresh water, which accumulating, in a wet season\r\n     and a spring-tide, made an irreparable breach, and thus ended an\r\n     experiment which _then_ cost altogether about £7000. \"And after\r\n     all, the nature of the ground did not answer the expectations of\r\n     the undertakers; for though that part adjoining Brading proved\r\n     tolerably good, nearly one-half of it was found to be a light\r\n     running sand.\" But it should be observed, that previous to the\r\n     above attempt, several of the rich meadows contiguous to the haven\r\n     were at different times taken in.\r\n\r\n     One circumstance was very remarkable: namely, A WELL, cased with\r\n     stone, was discovered near the middle of the haven;--an\r\n     incontestible evidence, that at some remote period, the spot was in\r\n     a very different condition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     To the very remarkable CHANGE which appears (by the discovery of a\r\n     well,) to have taken place in the condition of the haven--and the\r\n     threatened existence of St. Helen\u0027s Church, from the \"encroachment\r\n     of the sea,\"--we beg to call the attention of our more reflecting\r\n     readers. History and tradition are silent as to the cause; and the\r\n     popular opinion of the present day briefly dismisses the question\r\n     by ascribing it to an increased elevation of the sea. But this\r\n     hypothesis is not supported by the appearance of the coast\r\n     immediately to the westward of the haven, where some creeks or\r\n     inlets _have become dry_; a circumstance which induced the Rev. P.\r\n     Wyndham, who wrote almost the first intelligent Guide to the\r\n     island, to conclude that there actually had been a secession of\r\n     tides in this quarter; yet, singular enough, he makes no allusion\r\n     either to the haven or the church. Now as there is really no\r\n     evidence whatever in the neighbourhood that would lead us to\r\n     suppose in the slightest degree, that the sea has encroached upon\r\n     the land _by its gaining a higher_ GENERAL _level_ (an idea\r\n     deprecated by many eminent geologists), we must take the\r\n     alternative in accounting for the phenomenon, and infer that the\r\n     land of the haven must have SUNK at some very distant period, and\r\n     that more recently, the same fate attended the foundations of the\r\n     church, which certainly could not have been originally built so\r\n     very close to the water\u0027s edge, as to be constantly enveloped in\r\n     sea-foam during every fresh breeze from the east.\r\n\r\n     Analagous to the above mutation in the state of the land, is the\r\n     following singular fact related by Sir Rd. Worsley, of\r\n     Appuldurcombe, who, living as it were on the spot, was not likely\r\n     to be imposed upon. The reader is to picture to himself three very\r\n     high downs standing nearly in a line,--St. Catharine\u0027s, Week, and\r\n     Shanklin: the latter, when Sir Richard wrote the account in 1781,\r\n     he guessed to be about 100 feet higher than Week Down, but which\r\n     \"was barely visible\" over the latter from St. Catharine\u0027s, in the\r\n     younger days of many of the old inhabitants of Chale, and who had\r\n     also been told by their fathers that at one time Shanklin could be\r\n     seen only from the top of the beacon on St. Catharine\u0027s. \"This\r\n     testimony, if allowed,\" says the worthy baronet, \"argues either a\r\n     sinking of the intermediate down, or a rising of one of the other\r\n     hills, the causes of which are left for philosophical\r\n     investigation:\" and so with respect to the haven and the church, we\r\n     leave it as a curious question to amuse our scientific\r\n     friends--whether it is the sea that has risen, or the land which\r\n     has subsided?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nBEMBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n     \u003e\u003e _This is a peninsula about three miles long by one broad,\r\n     terminating abruptly on the sea-side in a range of_ SUBLIME CHALK\r\n     PRECIPICES. _The part easily accessible to strangers is White-cliff\r\n     Bay, two miles from the ferry._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     On account of the inconvenient situation of Bembridge as to the\r\n     usual _routes_, it is not so much visited as Freshwater, whose\r\n     precipices are on rather a grander scale, and the most celebrated\r\n     in Great Britain of this magnificent species of coast scenery. For\r\n     this reason, and also as the cliffs of both places agree almost\r\n     precisely in their geological character (for they are but the\r\n     termini of the same chain of hills), we shall merge the _general_\r\n     description of the former in that of the latter; but we would\r\n     advise the stranger who may sojourn at Ryde, by all means to visit\r\n     Bembridge, if he should decline going to Freshwater; and if in a\r\n     good boat on a fine day, so much the better,--he will be well\r\n     gratified with the _brilliant_ spectacle which these noble \"_white\r\n     cliffs of Albion_\" present.\r\n\r\nBefore the year 1830, Bembridge seemed to be shut out from intercourse\r\nwith the world: it was very rarely visited; possessed no facilities of\r\ncommunication; and had no charms to call the traveller aside from the\r\nroutine track. But owing to the WISE and spirited exertions of a\r\nresident gentleman, it was soon rendered a populous village.\r\n\r\nAmong the first improvements was the erection (by public subscription)\r\nof a handsome little church for the accommodation of the inhabitants,\r\nwho before had no place of episcopalian worship nearer than Brading: the\r\nnext consideration was the establishment of a horse-boat, and other\r\nregular means of passage across the haven:--land was sold off on\r\neligible terms for building; several tasty villas were soon erected, and\r\nample shrubberies formed:--new roads were projected, the old ones\r\nwidened and repaired, and travelling altogether rendered more agreeable.\r\nA respectable Hotel was also built at the same time, near the beach.\r\n\r\nThe face of the country about Bembridge is pleasant enough, being\r\nagreeably checquered by grove and meadow, cultivation and open\r\npasturage: but it is THE SURROUNDING PROSPECT which yields the chief\r\npleasure. The situation of the Church and other principal buildings, is\r\nsufficiently evident to the visitor from St. Helen\u0027s, or as he crosses\r\nthe ferry.\r\n\r\nThe chalk precipices of Bembridge are named _the Culvers_, from the\r\ncircumstance it is said, of their having been the haunt of immense\r\nnumbers of wild pigeons; and they are now, as has been already mentioned\r\n(p. 21), resorted to in the summer months by prodigious flights of\r\nvarious sea-fowl. There is a small cavern called HERMIT\u0027S HOLE in the\r\nface of the cliff, about thirty feet from the top; the descent to it\r\nhowever is steep and narrow, and it is comparatively but seldom visited.\r\n\r\nBEMBRIDGE LEDGE is a dangerous reef of rocks, stretching out into the\r\nsea a considerable distance: a floating beacon-light called \"the Nab\" is\r\nalways moored within a short distance, to warn ships of their position.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYAVERLAND. This is a straggling village near the sea-shore, between\r\nBrading and Sandown Fort. The little parish-church and the adjoining\r\nmansion (now converted into a farm house,) exhibit a venerable\r\nappearance, and being surrounded by groves of magnificent elms, the\r\nwhole presents one of the prettiest _rural_ scenes in the island; and to\r\nthe amateur of sketching, it must prove a treat. The Parsonage too will\r\nbe admired for its appropriate character and pleasant situation.--Passing\r\na few scattered cottages, our road will be on the pebbly beach to ...\r\n\r\nSANDOWN,\r\n\r\nAltogether an extensive village, containing several new houses built\r\nnear the sea-shore, intended for letting as summer lodgings: some of\r\nthem are large and splendidly furnished: and enjoy a beautiful view of\r\nthe British Channel, the dazzling cliffs of Bembridge, and the range of\r\ncoast for two or three miles in the direction of Shanklin. There is a\r\nchurch, newly erected in the upper part of the village: and a neat inn\r\non the beach.\r\n\r\nMidway between Sandown and Shanklin we pass through LAKE, a pretty\r\nhamlet, having a few cottages that let occasionally for lodgings during\r\nthe summer months.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nBRADING\r\n\r\nConsists of one long, ancient street (through which is the chief\r\nthoroughfare from Ryde to Shanklin and the Undercliff,) and a few good\r\nhouses recently built on the outskirts: it lies about half a mile from\r\nthe haven; and still retains some of the privileges of an ancient\r\nborough. The Church is considered the oldest in the island; as it was\r\ncertainly in existence early in the eighth century, though some date its\r\nerection so high as the sixth, and contend that the first islanders\r\nconverted to Christianity were here baptized. On account of its\r\nantiquity, the numerous relics which it contains, together with the many\r\nwell written inscriptions to be found on the tombstones in the cemetery\r\n(the most noted of which perhaps is the one erected to the memory of\r\n\"Little Jane,\") it is very frequently visited by parties making the\r\nsouthern tour. The surrounding country too is agreeably varied by wood\r\nand water, arable and pasture, and a very fine outline of hill and dale.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo return to Ryde or Newport over the downs from Brading, will be found\r\nexceedingly interesting to those strangers who delight in the\r\ncontemplation of grand prospects, and a most fertile and well\r\ncultivated country:--having no objection at the same time to a _hilly_\r\nroad as the price of their enjoyment, and which _we_ call the most\r\nbeautiful in the island.\r\n\r\n     But as artists are often enraptured with passages of scenery that\r\n     to others prove comparatively uninteresting, we subjoin a sketch by\r\n     Sir H. ENGLEFIELD, showing the deep interest and pleasure the\r\n     surrounding landscapes are capable of affording:--\r\n\r\n     \"To enjoy in all its glory, the complete view of the northern\r\n     tract, which in detail presents so many separate beauties, we must\r\n     ascend the chalk range that rises immediately from the woods of\r\n     Nunwell. When the weather is clear, it is impossible to describe\r\n     the magnificent scene which these hills command, from Brading\r\n     Downs, by Ashey Sea-mark, and soon quite to Arreton chalk-pit.\r\n\r\n     \"To the _north_, the woodlands form an almost continued velvet\r\n     carpet of near 10,000 acres, broken only by small farms, whose\r\n     thatched buildings relieve the deep tints of the forests. The\r\n     Wootton River winds beautifully among them, and beyond the whole\r\n     the Solent Sea spreads its waters, which in clear weather is tinged\r\n     with an azure more deep and beautiful than any I ever saw. The\r\n     Hampshire land rises in a succession of hills quite lost at length\r\n     in blue vapour. The inland view to the _south_ is far from\r\n     destitute of beauty, though less striking than the northern scene.\r\n     The vale between the chalk range and the southern hills is seen in\r\n     its full extent: and the southern hills themselves rise to a\r\n     majestic height. To the _eastward_ the sea is again visible over\r\n     the low lands of Sandown, and by its open expanse affords a fine\r\n     contrast to the Solent Channel.\r\n\r\n     \"The nearer objects on the southern slope are also very\r\n     interesting: Knighton House, with its venerable grey fronts mantled\r\n     with luxuriant ivy, and bosomed in the richest groves, is as\r\n     beautiful at a distance, as it is interesting on a nearer approach.\r\n     Arreton is also surrounded with trees, which group happily with the\r\n     pretty church and an old mansion now converted into a farm: and\r\n     from the western end of the downs, the country about Newport and\r\n     Carisbrooke is seen to great advantage. _Such is the faint outline\r\n     of a scene, which, in richness of tints, and variety of objects,\r\n     surpasses anything I ever saw._\"\r\n\r\n     _Note._--Since this was written, Knighton House has been pulled\r\n     down.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Objects between Brading and Newport._\r\n\r\nOur course will be for the first three miles due west. On the north side\r\nis NUNWELL, the oldest seat in the island, having been awarded by\r\nWilliam the Conqueror to the ancestors of Sir William Oglander, the\r\npresent proprietor. Noble specimens of every kind of forest-tree are to\r\nbe found in the park: particularly oaks, several of which are many\r\ncenturies old, the family having long employed every possible means of\r\npreserving these venerable chiefs of the grove. The house (a large,\r\nplain building,) stands at the foot of the down, and therefore is not\r\nseen from the road: but the surrounding park, woods, and farms of the\r\nestate, spread before the eye in a most beautiful style ...\r\n\r\n    \"With swelling slopes and groves of every green.\"\r\n\r\nASHEY SEA-MARK is very conspicuously seen, being seated on a high down,\r\nthree miles from Brading, four from Ryde, and five from Newport: it is a\r\nperfectly plain, triangular object, erected in the middle of the last\r\ncentury to assist pilots in navigating St. Helen\u0027s anchorage.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the down appears the pretty village of NEWCHURCH,\r\nin the direct road from Ryde to Godshill, \u0026c. The situation of the\r\nChurch is rather romantic, being nearly on the edge of a remarkably\r\nsteep sand-cliff, through which the road is cut, feathered with\r\nbrushwood and several overhanging trees.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf the tourist be returning to Newport, he will pass through the long\r\nvillage of ARRETON, whose church stands at the foot of the down of that\r\nname: it is of considerable antiquity,--and though its style of\r\narchitecture is certainly heavy, is upon the whole both picturesque and\r\nsingular. Its chief internal decoration is a beautiful mausoleum to the\r\nmemory of Sir Leonard W. Holmes, bart.: and in the churchyard is buried\r\nthe young woman celebrated for her piety in the popular tract of \"the\r\nDairyman\u0027s Daughter.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE ROMANTIC SCENERY\r\n\r\nOF THE ISLAND,\r\n\r\nEXHIBITED ALONG THE SOUTH-EASTERN COAST, FROM\r\n\r\nSHANKLIN TO BLACKGANG CHINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSHANKLIN.\r\n\r\n     \u003e\u003e THE CHINE, _a beautiful woody ravine in the sea-cliffs, is the\r\n     great object of attraction; inquire the road to the beach, and you\r\n     will be conducted through the scene back to the village;--of the\r\n     latter, a, pretty good idea may be formed in passing through it to\r\n     Bonchurch,_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere we enter upon the romantic scenery of the island. The village is\r\nmost delightfully rural, and though it has several roomy lodging-houses,\r\nand two large hotels, still, from the bold variety of the ground, and\r\nthe many shrubberies and clumps of fine elm and ash trees with which it\r\nis adorned, the dwellings are so hid from one another, that in almost\r\nevery point of view it has the pleasing appearance of being but a small\r\nquiet hamlet. Except in the most exposed parts, vegetation flourishes\r\nwith uncommon luxuriance,--even choice exotics: we would point to the\r\nParsonage as an instance, enveloped in myrtles that stand the rigors of\r\nwinter without protection: indeed it may well be said, that almost every\r\ncottage in this beautiful spot is surrounded ...\r\n\r\n    \"With fragrant turf, and flowers as wild and fair,\r\n    As ever dressed a bank, or scented summer air.\"\r\n\r\nBut the crowning feature from which it derives its celebrity as one of\r\nthe chief curiosities of the island, is THE CHINE--a term that certainly\r\ndoes not convey to a stranger any idea of the scene: it is a provincial\r\nexpression for a ravine or cleft in the cliffs of the shore, and of\r\nwhich there are several along the coast, possessing a beauty or\r\nsublimity that renders them highly interesting.\r\n\r\nHaving reached the beach, the visitor should take a short walk under the\r\ntowering sandrock precipices which range to the right and left for\r\nseveral miles, before he enters the Chine. Nowhere on the coast of the\r\nisland is there a more charming stretch of shore,--for the sand is of a\r\ncool dark color, _firm enough for wheel-carriages and horses to be used\r\nby invalids_, and therefore proves equally alluring to the aged as to\r\nthe young, to enjoy salubrious exercise and recreation; it extends\r\nnorthward to Sandown--about two miles; its monotony being broken by\r\noccasional pools of sea-water, and a sprinkling of weed-covered rocks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE CHINE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHANKLIN CHINE, ISLE OF WIGHT. (_Descent to the Beach._)]\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the cliff stands a fisherman\u0027s cottage, which may attract\r\nour attention from its picturesque situation.\r\n\r\nThe first view of the Chine from the beach is not the most favorable: as\r\nthe eye of the spectator is much too low to comprehend all the deep and\r\nbold windings of the chasm, which contribute so essentially to its\r\nromantic effect: but, gradually ascending by a narrow path, we soon open\r\na wider view, and should then pause, to contemplate it on every side. We\r\nsee suspended on the opposite slope, the humble ale house, resting\r\n\r\n    \"Beneath an aged oak\u0027s embowering shade.\"\r\n\r\nJust below it, a pretty rose-mantled cottage: and not far off, the gable\r\nend of a gentleman\u0027s villa, so prominently seated near the margin of the\r\nprecipice, as to completely overlook the awful abyss. This view is\r\naltogether picturesque and animated: for the foreground is exceedingly\r\nbold,--and the prospect of Sandown Bay and the sublime cliffs of\r\nBembridge, give wonderful brilliancy and interest to the perspective.\r\n\r\nAs we advance, the scene becomes increasingly romantic, especially when\r\nwe are about half-way through it: for the deep sides of the chasm so\r\nfold into one another as to exclude all prospect, and yet afford a great\r\ndiversity of coloring, light, and shade; the one side being beautifully\r\nhung with indigenous trees or shrubs, and the uncovered portions of the\r\ncliff of a glowing tint; while the opposite side presents the contrast\r\nof a sombre hue, and is generally too steep to admit of much vegetation\r\never gaining a permanent footing. Nor is the most critical eye annoyed\r\nby the indications of unnecessary artificial improvements--which so\r\noften tend to destroy the delightful robe of simplicity that such scenes\r\nof Nature\u0027s creation wear, _when they are fortunate enough to escape the\r\ninfliction of man\u0027s refinements_.\r\n\r\n    \"Still slowly climb the many-winding way,\r\n    And frequent turn to linger as you go.\"\r\n\r\nWe now approach the waterfall, at the HEAD OF THE CHINE; and should\r\nthere have been lately any heavy rains, it forms a noble cascade of\r\nabout 30 feet; but after a continuance of dry weather, it is reduced to\r\na scanty rill.\r\n\r\nAscending by a rude path cut in the side of the cliff, we pass through a\r\nrustic wicket, and take our leave of this celebrated scene, which has no\r\ndoubt been formed by the slow operation of the streamlet in the course\r\nof many ages, insignificant as it may appear to a casual visitor in the\r\nmiddle of summer. The Chine of Blackgang is indebted for its origin to a\r\nsimilar cause: and this of Shanklin would have gone on rapidly\r\nincreasing, had not the proprietor resorted to the aid of masonry,\r\ndraining, piling, \u0026c. to arrest in some measure its further progress\r\ntowards the village.--See p. 33 of the \"Vectis Scenery\" for a full\r\naccount of the formation of the Chines.\r\n\r\nThe sides of this chasm are about 200 feet in perpendicular height, and\r\nperhaps 300 wide at the top, near the beach, gradually diminishing\r\ntowards the Head or waterfall, where the sides are perpendicular, and\r\nonly a few yards asunder.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe earthy precipices between Shanklin and Luccombe Chines are called\r\nDUNNOSE,--they form the southern termination of Sandown Bay, which is a\r\nbeautiful stretch of shore of above five miles in extent, bounded on the\r\nnorth by the white cliffs of Bembridge.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs we pursue our tour we can trace the course of the Chine (above the\r\nhead), by the freshness and luxuriant growth of the trees that stand on\r\nits narrow banks: and just as we approximate the little parish-church,\r\npass over a bridge thrown across it--but the streamlet itself is almost\r\nhidden by wild brushwood and aquatic weeds. The spring-head is a little\r\nabove the church.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHANKLIN CHURCH, I.W. _And the Road leading to Luccombe \u0026\r\nthe Undercliff_]\r\n\r\nThe Plate represents the church, and a remarkable portion of the road on\r\nquitting the village for the back of the island; it is seen ascending\r\ncircuitously the side of a steep down, between a hanging copse and\r\nseveral groups of the finest ash trees,--one of which (on the\r\nleft-hand,) has long been celebrated for its amplitude and beauty.\r\n\r\n     It is quite impossible for language to convey more than a faint\r\n     idea of the magnificent and interesting prospect which gradually\r\n     opens to view as the traveller ascends the mountain ridge: the\r\n     British Channel spreads its blue waters as the boundary on the one\r\n     side; the greatest portion of the island recedes in the most\r\n     charming gradations on the other: and the Solent Channel presents\r\n     the animated appearance of a noble river, crowded with ships of\r\n     every description; while the opposite coast of Hampshire and Sussex\r\n     may be traced more or less distinctly for 70 or 80 miles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA series of pasturing downs stretch for several miles nearly parallel\r\nwith the sea-coast: of these the nearest is Shanklin--its northern slope\r\nbeing abruptly broken by a fine range of cliff, composed chiefly of gray\r\nfree-stone feathered by hanging woods, and on the edge of this beautiful\r\nprecipice stand some very picturesque ruins called ...\r\n\r\nCOOKE\u0027s CASTLE,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COOKE\u0027s CASTLE. _An ancient ruin on the Appuldurcombe\r\nEstate--Isle of Wight._]\r\n\r\nWhich being seen from a considerable distance in various directions, and\r\nnever before published, appeared to the Artist to well merit a sketch.\r\nSir Richard Worsley, in his History of the Isle of Wight, states it to\r\nbe the \"ruin of an ancient castle\" (though it has been said that it was\r\nbuilt as an object of view from Appuldurcombe House); but whether\r\nartificial, or really a relic of antiquity, is of little importance,\r\nwhile it proves so conspicuous an ornament to the scene.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLUCCOMBE CHINE\r\n\r\nIs another chasm in the sea-cliffs, similar to Shanklin in its\r\ncharacter, but on a very inferior scale: and therefore is seldom visited\r\nby those in a vehicle who have little time to spare. But many walk from\r\nShanklin to it, either on the beach (if the tide be ebbing), or by a\r\nfoot-path near the edge of the cliffs, the distance being about two\r\nmiles: either way is extremely pleasant. A few houses and cottages\r\nscattered about, serve to enliven the scene.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now approach a most singular and romantic tract of the south-eastern\r\ncoast, dividing the claim of _interest_ even with the sublime scenery at\r\nthe west end of the island: we mean ...\r\n\r\nTHE UNDERCLIFF,\r\n\r\nWhich commences at East End, and terminates at Blackgang Chine, an\r\nextent of above eight miles, averaging about one mile\u0027s breadth: and\r\nbounded on the land-side by a towering ridge of perpendicular stone\r\ncliffs, or precipitous chalky hills; presenting in many parts the\r\nvenerable time-worn appearance of some ancient fortress. Between this\r\ncraggy ridge and the sea-cliffs, every spot bears the striking impress\r\nof some violent convulsion, such in fact as would be produced by an\r\nearthquake: but in proportion to the time that shall have elapsed, so\r\nall the more rugged marks of devastation are either obliterated by the\r\nliberal hand of Nature, or converted into positive beauties. Originally\r\nthe whole of this tract, or nearly so, was rock resting on a sort of\r\nloose marly foundation: this being perpetually exposed to the\r\nundermining action of the sea at its foot; accelerated in wet seasons\r\nby the marle being rendered soft and yielding,--it is evident that,\r\nsooner or later, such a foundation would give way to the immense\r\nsuperincumbent pressure, and be attended with all the direful effects of\r\na real earthquake.\r\n\r\nMost probably other subsidences will yet take place, until more of the\r\noozy, sliding foundation shall be removed, and its place occupied by a\r\nsufficient quantity of fallen rock, as will secure the stability of the\r\nground; as we find to be the case for the greater part of this singular\r\ntract, which has certainly been in a state of repose for seven or eight\r\ncenturies at least. Fragments of the cliff are indeed frequently\r\nshivered off, but rarely or never attended with any very injurious\r\nconsequences: it is those extensive _landslips_ which are alarming, when\r\nmany acres of valuable land are completely overturned and laid waste in\r\na few hours. The huge masses of solid rock thus torn and dashed about,\r\nproduce the grandest scenes of terror: but are at the same time the\r\nsource of those singular beauties--that variety of fractured cliff and\r\nbroken ground, which are the greatest ornaments of this romantic\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nEAST END.\r\n\r\n     \u003e\u003e_The Tourist ought, if possible, to walk through this very\r\n     romantic scene, and if in a vehicle, be upon his guard that the\r\n     driver does not hurry him by it, as is often the case._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere, as we have said before, the Undercliff commences: and as soon as\r\nthe stranger has nearly compassed the valley of Luccombe, he should\r\nparticularly enquire for the spot which is the entrance to this romantic\r\nscene ...\r\n\r\n    \"Where twines a path in shadow hid,\r\n    Round many a rocky pyramid.\"\r\n\r\nThe distance is only a mile: the carriage in the mean time may proceed\r\non to Bonchurch. But should the party decline the walk, they ought at\r\nleast to alight, and advance near enough to the edge of the\r\nprecipice, to have a view of the interesting scene below; and they must\r\nbear in mind, that though it lies within a few yards of the road, yet\r\n_to a person passing by_, there is no indication of its being so near.\r\n\r\nThe great interest of East End arises partly from its present wild\r\ncharacter, and partly from its being the scene of the latest formidable\r\nlandslips that have occurred in the island. In the year 1810, a founder\r\ntook place which destroyed about twenty acres of land: this was followed\r\nby another, eight years after, that ruined in one night at least thirty\r\nacres more: at which time above twenty full-grown trees were uprooted,\r\nand several of them completely buried in the awful wreck. It therefore\r\naffords the inquisitive traveller the best opportunity of examining the\r\ncause of the peculiar character of this part of the island.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nBONCHURCH.\r\n\r\n     \u003e\u003e_Formerly this was one of the most romantic scenes in the island,\r\n     but has lately been converted into a fashionable village. Amidst a\r\n     profusion of new houses, more or less tasty in their style--a\r\n     villa, called_ EAST DENE, _and the neighbouring old_ CHURCH_, are\r\n     all that will here particularly call the stranger from the\r\n     carriage-road._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the year 1834, this beautiful spot was advertised to be sold off in\r\nsmall lots for building 18 or 20 villas!--a circumstance much regretted\r\nby the admirers of the peculiar scenery of the Undercliff, which was\r\nexhibited here in its utmost perfection. Nearly the whole of the land is\r\nnow disposed of; some of the houses were built for the purpose of\r\nletting lodgings; one has been opened as a first-rate Hotel; but the\r\ngreater number are private residences,--and certainly it must prove a\r\nmost enviable retreat for families or invalids during the winter months.\r\nIt is impossible for any spot to be better adapted for a number of\r\nhouses being built in a comparatively small compass: for the whole of\r\nthe ground is so romantically tossed about by the sportive hand of\r\nNature,--presenting here a lofty ridge of rocks, there a woody dell\r\nadorned with a purling stream or a limpid pool, that most of the houses\r\nare completely hid from each other\u0027s view.\r\n\r\n     From the bad taste which too generally prevails--we mean the\r\n     _vanity of glare_--the affectation of _elegance_,--so frequently\r\n     carried out at the expense of all propriety, we were not without\r\n     apprehension that many of the gentry at Bonchurch would also\r\n     neglect the essential rule, that _the peculiar character of every\r\n     scene demands an_ APPROPRIATE STYLE _in building and decoration_;\r\n     for it avails little to have ivy-mantled rocks and mossy cliffs,\r\n     the sunny knoll and the shady glen, with their groves and\r\n     streams,--if the Genius of the spot be not consulted, and HARMONY\r\n     made the rule of every innovation and improvement. In a word, it is\r\n     too often in building as in dress, that many persons resort to show\r\n     and refinement as the surest means of attracting the world\u0027s\r\n     admiration for their superior taste and rank! But in justice to the\r\n     Gentlemen who have located in this fairy-land, we must acknowledge\r\n     that they for the most part avoided (as far as was possible),\r\n     disturbing the natural beauties of the place, and have studied to\r\n     make their happy retreats ...\r\n\r\n        \"Smile with charms\r\n    CONGENIAL TO THE SOIL, and all its own:\r\n        For Ornament\r\n    When foreign or fantastic, never charmed.\"\r\n\r\n     \u003e\u003eThe reader who may feel an interest on this subject is referred\r\n     to pp. 36 and 43 of the \"_Vectis Scenery_.\"\r\n\r\nThe most delightful residence at Bonchurch is called EAST DENE: the\r\nbeauty of its locality is unrivaled; the exterior of the house in a\r\nchaste style; and the interior fitted-up and furnished at a great\r\nexpense in the antique mode of the 16th century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _THE PARISH CHURCH OF_ BONCHURCH _ISLE OF WIGHT_]\r\n\r\nThe Tourist should certainly visit the old Church, which stands near the\r\nshore, and not far from the road, though concealed from it by a lofty\r\nridge of the fallen cliff: it is of simple construction, but beautifully\r\ncanopied by a grove of magnificent elms, and is supposed to have been\r\nbuilt in the 11th century,--which is taken as a proof that this part of\r\nthe Undercliff was certainly in a state of repose at the time of its\r\nerection; and has undoubtedly remained so ever since. Still, we cannot\r\nquestion for a moment, but this spot must have been in some previous age\r\n(judging from analogy,) subjected to the same catastrophes which we have\r\nwitnessed even in our own time in its immediate neighbourhood at East\r\nEnd. There is also a new Church, of a neat design, beautifully nestled\r\namongst the rocks in the higher part of the village.\r\n\r\nAs ROCK, in this part of the island, constitutes the chief source of\r\npicturesque effect, it would be an omission not to point out two crags\r\nwhich have gained quite a celebrity for their age and beauty: the first\r\nis _Hadfield\u0027s Look-out_, boldly rising from the road; the other a\r\nprominence in the face of the upper range of precipices, called _the\r\nPulpit Rock_: the former has generally the appendage of a\r\nflag-staff,--the latter a rude cross, in unison with its name.\r\n\r\nThe road through the valley of Bonchurch presents a most enchanting\r\nscene: shaded by noble trees; and edged by bold rocky knolls,--and a\r\nsmall pellucid lake and stream, beyond which appears a romantic tract of\r\nbroken ground and wild brushwood, backed by the venerable grey\r\nland-cliff and the lofty brow of St. Boniface Down. On emerging from\r\nthis beautiful spot, we have on our right a genteel residence called ST.\r\nBONIFACE HOUSE, situated close at the foot of the high down which gives\r\nthe name; built in a very chaste rural style; and embellished by some\r\nnoble trees, and a sparkling rill.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now open a general view of the fast-improving town of ...\r\n\r\nVENTNOR.\r\n\r\n\u003e\u003e_This is the chief resting-place between Shanklin and Niton. The_\r\nCHURCH, _and the_ COVE, _are the most interesting features_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVentnor has risen into importance with a rapidity greater than any other\r\nplace in the island: for as late as the year 1830 it numbered but about\r\nhalf-a-dozen cottages, one hotel, a small inn, and the accompaniment of\r\na humble grist-mill, so necessary in a _retired hamlet_ as this was\r\n_then_. But such has since been the eagerness for building, that land\r\nfor the purpose which was at that time sold for £100 per acre, soon\r\nadvanced to 300 or £400; latterly the price has risen at the rate of 800\r\nto £1000 per acre for the more eligible sites. And at present there are\r\nthree first-rate hotels and several minor inns; well stocked shops in\r\nalmost every line of business: and medical men established on the spot.\r\nSeveral streets of considerable extent are completed, others are rapidly\r\nprogressing; and much has also been done in the way of public\r\nimprovements, such as paving, lighting, \u0026c. The new Esplanade, on the\r\nbeach, cannot fail to prove a delightful convenience both to the\r\ninhabitants and visitors at Ventnor.\r\n\r\nIt is greatly indebted for its prosperity to Dr. Clarke\u0027s popular\r\nTreatise, to which we have already referred (p. 16,) when speaking of\r\nthe climate generally. Its progress was still more accelerated by the\r\ninterest which the proprietor of Steephill Castle, John Hambrough, esq.,\r\ntook in its success, by erecting a handsome church, a large free-school,\r\nparsonage, \u0026c.\r\n\r\nBuilding being still carried on with undiminished speculation, the\r\ngeneral appearance of the town must be consequently anything but\r\nagreeable--nor has there been the lapse of sufficient time for the\r\ngrowth of the shrubberies (however genial the climate,) to attain that\r\nsize which would afford the relief of even a partial screen. Little\r\ntherefore can be particularized under the present _changing aspect_ of\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\nAmong the buildings which attract attention in entering by the old road,\r\nare the connected range called St. Boniface Terrace, occupying a\r\ncommanding situation, and the houses concurring in one general design:\r\nand below, some extensive erections, of rather a novel appearance to the\r\nuntraveled eye, being strictly in imitation of the airy and picturesque\r\nstyle of the Italian villa.\r\n\r\nThe somewhat confused appearance of Ventnor is no doubt owing to its\r\nunexpected advance having prevented the adoption of any uniform\r\nground-plan, as would no doubt have been done could the proprietor of\r\nthe land have foreseen the magnitude to which the place was so soon to\r\nextend,--for in this respect a considerable improvement is visible in\r\nthe latest-erected part of the town. The most regularly laid-out streets\r\nare near the shore: and one branch-road runs by the edge of the\r\nsea-cliffs for about half a mile towards Bonchurch, thus affording the\r\nhouses an uninterrupted view of the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: To JOHN HAMBROUGH _Esq. of Steephill Castle, in the Isle\r\nof Wight_, _This view of_ ST.

CATHARINE\u0027S CHURCH is a beautiful feature in every respect, both in\r\nits exterior and interior, being the neatest in the island: and situated\r\nas it is on a commanding knoll nearly in the middle of the town, affords\r\nan admirable relief to the whole scene, by arresting the eye from the\r\nscattered glare of the surrounding slate-roofed and white-walled\r\nbuildings,--which are almost the universal character of the houses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe COVE presents at certain times a very animated and engaging picture:\r\nfishermen preparing for or returning from their voyage; invalids and\r\nother respectable parties sauntering or reclining on the sunny beach:\r\nsome reading, others amused in listening to, and watching the curling\r\nwaves expire at their feet in spreading foam. The material of the shore\r\nis principally fine shingle, or very small pebbles, among which\r\nparticles are frequently picked up, possessing a brilliancy that has\r\ngained for them the title of \"Isle of Wight diamonds;\" and though they\r\nmay be comparatively of inferior value in point of intrinsic\r\nquality,--still, the _interest_ taken in searching for them must prove a\r\nsource of the most agreeable employment to those visitors whose health\r\nprecludes any exercise of a more active nature.\r\n\r\nST. BONIFACE DOWN, which forms a green back-ground to the view, is also\r\nan object of interest (at least with artists or amateurs of sketching,)\r\nthat ought not to be passed by unnoticed. It is exceedingly steep: has a\r\nnever-failing spring on its lofty summit, and is often cheerfully\r\nsprinkled with sheep, of the South-down breed, safely nibbling the close\r\nherbage on its precipitous side.\r\n\r\n     Speaking of the down, we should deserve to be censured by those of\r\n     our elderly readers who may have been to Ventnor ere it reached the\r\n     magnitude of a town, not to inform them, that _the then only Hotel_\r\n     (so beautifully seated close at the foot of the hill,) _is no\r\n     longer a place of public accommodation_; the license has been\r\n     transferred. Many were the respectable parties of the olden time\r\n     who used to amuse themselves with the attempt to gain the summit of\r\n     the down,--sometimes successfully, but more frequently at the\r\n     expense of a rather too precipitate descent, to the no small\r\n     diversion of their friends who had less daring to make the\r\n     experiment. In this age of refinement, such displays of rural\r\n     agility would be regarded as \"utterly vulgar!\" there are however\r\n     more circuitous and accessible paths by which we may reach the\r\n     eminence, and hence enjoy a most delightful prospect.\r\n\r\n     In concluding this brief notice of Ventnor, it would be very unfair\r\n     to Dr. Clarke, not to mention the fact, that he was decidedly\r\n     opposed to the residences of invalids (with pulmonary consumption)\r\n     being accumulated together \"_in the form of a Town_;\" he recommends\r\n     that a number of _detached_ houses should be built along the\r\n     Undercliff, each surrounded with the protection of a garden-wall\r\n     and a few trees. But, begging the Doctor\u0027s pardon, we heartily\r\n     rejoice that his advice could not be acted upon to any considerable\r\n     extent (except at Ventnor and Bonchurch); because fortunately the\r\n     most eligible and attractive spots in this romantic district are in\r\n     the holding of gentlemen who have chosen such for their _private_\r\n     residences: and certainly, if selfishness was ever pardonable, it\r\n     is so in this instance; nay, for our part, we really congratulate\r\n     the public, that the spirit of exclusiveness so widely exists in\r\n     this happy region of the sublime and beautiful. For what a\r\n     lamentable transformation it would prove of the natural character\r\n     of the scenery, to have many large and often glary houses obtruding\r\n     upon the eye in every direction! banishing all the _wildest_ and\r\n     most interesting local beauties, for domestic convenience or\r\n     fantastic embellishment! Where then would be the attraction to call\r\n     the thousands annually to our romantic isle? Where those UNIQUE\r\n     LANDSCAPES which now constitute its proudest charm?\r\n\r\n     And after all, the Doctor\u0027s objection to a residence in town, is\r\n     largely compensated for in the case of Ventnor, by the many\r\n     advantages afforded to invalids, that could be procured only in a\r\n     populous place: such for instance as regular stage-coaches running\r\n     to and from Ryde and other places; a good landing-place;\r\n     bathing-machines; a post-office and reading-rooms; the location of\r\n     several apothecaries and eminent physicians: tradesmen of almost\r\n     every description; and the facility of enjoying society in the\r\n     dullest winter months.\r\n\r\nWestward of Ventnor, we have a sudden and most agreeable transition from\r\nthe glare of the town to a quiet picture of rural scenery, broken only\r\nby two or three cottages neatly built in the antique style; this is the\r\ncommencement of the property of Mr. Hambrough (of Steephill Castle),\r\nwhich extends to St. Lawrence, the estate of Earl Yarborough; succeeded\r\nby Old Park; and near Niton, the seats of Mrs. Arnold, Sir W. Gordon,\r\nand Mrs. Vine: altogether a delightful distance of above four miles;\r\nwhich we hope will long escape any desecration of its beauties by the\r\noperations of building speculators.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAPPULDURCOMBE.\r\n\r\nThis splendid seat, from its proximity to the Undercliff, is most\r\nfrequently embraced either in the south-eastern or the continued Tour,\r\nin preference to giving it a separate day: therefore here is perhaps the\r\nbest place for its notice, especially as the regular road from Ventnor\r\nto Newport passes close by: and as it is only two miles from the former\r\ntown. It is thus described by Sir Richard Worsley, in his \"History of\r\nthe Isle of Wight:\"\r\n\r\n     \"The house is pleasantly situated about seven miles south of the\r\n     town of Newport: it has four regular fronts of the Corinthian\r\n     order, built of freestone; the pilasters, cornices, ballustrades,\r\n     and other ornamental parts are of Portland stone; the roof is\r\n     covered with Westmoreland slates. The grand entrance in the east\r\n     front is through a hall 54 feet in length by 24 in breadth, adorned\r\n     with eight beautiful columns of the Ionic order resembling\r\n     porphyry. On this floor are several handsome apartments, containing\r\n     many valuable portraits, and other good paintings; the offices are\r\n     very commodious, and on the first and attic stories are upwards of\r\n     twenty bed-chambers with dressing-rooms. The house was begun by Sir\r\n     Robert Worsley, in 1710: and completed by Sir Richard Worsley, who\r\n     made considerable additions, and much improved upon the original\r\n     design.\"\r\n\r\nSir Richard spent a great portion of his life in collecting the\r\npaintings and other relics of antiquity which adorn the mansion, and\r\npublished a very sumptuous descriptive work, entitled \"Museum\r\nWorsleyanum.\" The Estate descended to the Pelham family by the marriage\r\nof the Baronet\u0027s niece to the late Earl Yarborough.\r\n\r\nThe park of Appuldurcombe is extensive; and the soil being extremely\r\nrich, supports a great number both of deer and cattle,--the former of\r\nwhich is nowhere else to be found in the island. At the back of the\r\nmansion rises a lofty hill, whose sides are hung with groves of noble\r\nbeech, interspersed with many venerable oaks. On the summit is an\r\nobelisk, originally seventy feet high, built of Cornish granite, to the\r\nmemory of Sir Robert Worsley: but of late years it has suffered severely\r\nfrom the high winds, to the violence of which its elevated position\r\nrenders it so exposed. From almost every part of this down we gain the\r\nmost splendid views; below, is the rich vale of Arreton, Newchurch, and\r\nGodshill: beyond is seen on the north, Portsmouth and the neighbouring\r\nanchorages, with the wooded heights above Southampton Water; eastward\r\nare the beautiful shores of Sandown Bay; to the west the prospect is\r\ncontinued far beyond the white cliffs of Freshwater, by the coasts of\r\nHants and Dorset: and on the south expands the azure horizon of the\r\nboundless ocean.\r\n\r\nN.B. Strangers desirous of visiting Appuldurcombe, must provide\r\nthemselves with tickets at the office of the stewards, Messrs. Sewell,\r\nSolicitors, Newport: the days allowed are Tuesdays and Fridays, between\r\nthe hours of 11 and 4 o\u0027clock.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nGODSHILL,\r\n\r\nBordering on Appuldurcombe Park, is a populous village, chiefly\r\nremarkable for the very picturesque situation of the Church, a large and\r\nvenerable pile, which stands upon a steep hill in the centre of the\r\nvillage,--commanding such an extensive and beautiful prospect as will of\r\nitself repay the tourist for the trouble of ascending. The interior of\r\nthe church is enriched by several interesting monuments, ancient and\r\nmodern, in memory of the various possessors of the Appuldurcombe\r\nestates,--the most sumptuous being that to Sir J. Leigh and his lady,\r\nwhose marble effigies are canopied by a beautifully ornamented arch; and\r\nthe massive tomb of Sir Richard Worsley, which occupies the south\r\ntransept, where a colored window is placed to give it greater\r\neffect.--Godshill has a small country inn called the Griffin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe distance from Ventnor to Godshill is four miles:--and thence to\r\nNewport, six: the country is well-cultivated, but presents no object to\r\ncall for particular notice: we pass the hamlet of ROOKLEY: and the\r\nvillas of PIDFORD and STANDEN.\r\n\r\nWHITWELL is a very retired village, winding between Godshill and Niton:\r\nand having a church of some antiquity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReturned to the Undercliff, the next place in our route which boasts of\r\nsuperior scenic beauty is ...\r\n\r\nSTEEPHILL,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEEPHILL, UNDERCLIFF, ISLE OF WIGHT.]\r\n\r\nWhere a splendid CASTLE was erected in the year 1833, by J. Hambrough,\r\nesq. (thence often called after his name), on a broad terrace of rock\r\nthat rises almost perpendicularly from the present road: and here it may\r\nnot be quite uninteresting to state--at least to some of our friends who\r\nused to visit the island years ago, that the castle occupies the very\r\nsite of the once-noted Cottage of the late Earl Dysart, and which was\r\nfor many years that nobleman\u0027s favorite retreat. Steephill was then a\r\nmost charming rural hamlet; but the cottages are removed (much to the\r\nadvantage of the tenants), to afford a scope in the grounds\r\ncorresponding with the dignity of the new mansion. Rustic simplicity and\r\nthe wilder graces have given way to elegance and polished decoration:\r\nbut whether the alteration\r\n\r\n    \"Adds beauties to what Nature plann\u0027d before,\"\r\n\r\nIs merely a question of taste, on which we shall not presume to decide:\r\nvarious are the opinions,\r\n\r\n          --\"And many a stranger stops,\r\n    With curious eye, to censure or admire.\"\r\n\r\nAs the public are now excluded from the garden and pleasure-grounds, it\r\nis rather difficult to get a good view of the castle; the best places\r\nhowever are ... a lofty knoll or promontory on the opposite side of the\r\nroad,--and a rocky mound near THE CAVE, which is in the face of the\r\nsea-cliffs, marked by a flag-staff; and there is, close by, a path to\r\nthe beach. Half an hour\u0027s saunter would be quite sufficient to enable a\r\nvisitor to judge of the beauty of the scene--which at one time procured\r\nit the title of _Queen of the Undercliff_. If but five minutes can be\r\nspared, the tourist ought to quit his vehicle, and reach the brow of the\r\npromontory above alluded to, were it only for the sake of the delightful\r\nprospect which it affords.\r\n\r\nThe coast of Steephill forms a pleasant little cove or bay, with\r\nremarkably bold and picturesque headlands: and the place altogether\r\nequals any part of the Undercliff in its natural embellishment of rich\r\ngroves and sparkling streams, mossy rocks, and broken ground.\r\n\r\n     DESCRIPTION OF THE CASTLE.--In the design of this stately edifice,\r\n     it appears to have been the aim of the architect to combine, as\r\n     much as possible, all the internal advantages of a plain mansion,\r\n     with the commanding form and embellished detail which usually\r\n     characterize a castellated structure. It is not therefore open to\r\n     an objection which lies against many of the most picturesque\r\n     specimens of this dignified style of building--that internal\r\n     convenience was sacrificed to the production of bold and pleasing\r\n     contrasts in the face of the exterior: or that it was the growth of\r\n     successive improvements. Indeed, both inside and out, all appears\r\n     to be handsomely proportioned and well-arranged; while in any point\r\n     of view the whole presents an aspect of elegant simplicity.--The\r\n     general form of the castle is an oblong; and the most prominent\r\n     features ... one majestic square tower which springs from about the\r\n     centre of the north side; another tower of an octagon form at the\r\n     south-eastern angle; and a beautiful hall-entrance on the east. The\r\n     predominant tint is a dark grey: but the battlements, quoins, and\r\n     mouldings, are of a light warm color, resembling the Bath stone.\r\n     This opposition of tints has a most pleasing, chaste effect, when\r\n     closely examined: but at a distance the whole melts into a sober\r\n     hue, like the grey impression of time, and hence harmonizes the\r\n     more sweetly with the surrounding scenery. Both kinds of stone were\r\n     procured on the spot.--The architect was the late Mr. James\r\n     Sanderson, of Ryde.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _Remarks on the Exclusion of Strangers from most of the Gentlemen\u0027s\r\n     Seats_.--However provoking it may prove to many visitors when\r\n     making the tour of the island, to be shut out from a view of some\r\n     of the most charming seats, still it may be justified in a\r\n     considerable degree; and we feel it our duty to repeat what we have\r\n     stated elsewhere, that we know several gentlemen who would freely\r\n     open their gates to respectable visitors, provided they could be\r\n     assured of every party being contented with a general view of the\r\n     local beauties, without indulging a too prying curiosity; and at\r\n     the same time would _refrain from plucking choice flowers, fruits,\r\n     and shrubs_, many of which may perhaps have been cultivated by the\r\n     hands of the owner with an affection of no little solicitude and\r\n     pride; and of course it is not always convenient to keep a person\r\n     merely to act as an attendant. But a more decisive reason with many\r\n     gentlemen who love retirement is, that from the island becoming\r\n     every year more and more attractive with pleasure-parties, an\r\n     _unlimited admission_ of strangers would at once annihilate all the\r\n     charms of rural seclusion; it would in fact be converting the\r\n     flowery walks of a quiet country-villa into as giddy a promenade as\r\n     almost any popular tea-garden in the suburbs of the metropolis.\r\n     Still however, speaking generally, it requires only some slight\r\n     grounds of introduction: and in the absence of the family there is\r\n     of course less difficulty,--it being then a privilege often given\r\n     to the servants.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nST. LAWRENCE.\r\n\r\n\u003e\u003e_The_ CHURCH, _here, is from its diminutiveness, quite an object of\r\ncuriosity; and the stranger will also notice_ THE WELL, _on the\r\nroad-side; but the_ VILLA _and_ COTTAGE _are both secluded from public\r\nview_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Here lawns, and groves, and op\u0027ning prospects break\r\n    With sweet surprize upon the wand\u0027ring eye:--\r\n    While through romantic scenes and hanging woods.\r\n    And valleys green, and rocks, and hollow dales,\r\n    We rove enchanted.\"\r\n\r\nThe scenery of St. Lawrence is a singular union of the cultivated with\r\nthe wild and romantic--a pleasing interchange of the elegance of\r\nsplendid retirement with the unobtrusive dwellings of laboring peasants,\r\nscattered amidst sheltering groves and ivy-covered rocks. Here the Rt.\r\nHon. Earl Yarborough has ...\r\n\r\n    \"A country-cottage--near a chrystal flood,\r\n    A winding valley, and a lofty wood;\"\r\n\r\nLong celebrated as the favorite retreat of the late Sir Richard Worsley,\r\nof Appuldurcombe Park, who embellished it in quite a classical\r\nstyle--planting a vineyard, decorating the grounds with models of\r\nancient temples, \u0026c. The house has since been considerably enlarged, and\r\nornamented in the old-English style with elaborate barge-boards and\r\npinnacles. At a short distance is the recently built residence of his\r\nLordship\u0027s brother, the Hon. Capt. C.D. Pelham, R.N.--also in the\r\nElizabethan style. By way of contradistinction, the original is\r\nemphatically called _the Villa_, and the latter, _the Cottage_. It is\r\nmuch to be regretted, that the public have of late been altogether\r\nexcluded from the grounds--from even walking on the edge of the\r\nsea-cliffs!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST LAWRENCE CHURCH _UNDERCLIFF ISLE OF WIGHT_]\r\n\r\nThe miniature CHURCH seldom fails of proving an amusing object with\r\nevery visitor,--for it ranks among the smallest parochial places of\r\nreligious worship in Great Britain: its belfry, the pretty little porch,\r\nand its several windows, are all in character; it has however lately\r\nbeen found necessary to lengthen the building, in consequence of the\r\nincrease of population in the vicinity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ST LAWRENCE.--The WELL near the Marine Villa of the\r\nRight Honourable Lord Yarborough.--Isle of Wight._]\r\n\r\nTHE WELL encloses a fountain of ever-running crystal water, the soft\r\nmurmurs of which combine with the surrounding scene to produce the most\r\nagreeable feelings; and it is marked by so much of that beautiful\r\nsimplicity which is the foundation of picturesque effect, that perhaps\r\nno other object in its charming neighbourhood, except the little church,\r\nwill afford the stranger more immediate pleasure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE ROAD FROM ST. LAWRENCE TO NITON.\r\n\r\n     \u003e\u003e_For the succeeding mile and a half, our attention will be called\r\n     to no one particular object; but we shall have the Undercliff in\r\n     all its native character, a circumstance which must prove\r\n     gratifying to those who admire Nature in_ HER OWN _attire_,\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe reader will be pleased, we have no doubt, with the following brief\r\nnotice of this part of the coast, by the late celebrated Mrs.\r\nRadcliffe:--\r\n\r\n     \"Oct. 15, 1811.--Passed Lord Dysart\u0027s beautiful cottage: it stands\r\n     at some distance from the shore, and has several distinct roofs,\r\n     well thatched: stands at the head of a winding lawn, with a fine\r\n     beech-grove, and richly-colored copse. The little parish-church of\r\n     St. Lawrence, perhaps the smallest in England, stands on a knoll,\r\n     and terminates the cultivated valley; immediately beyond which we\r\n     entered upon a scene of the wildest grandeur and solemnity. Many of\r\n     the ruinous precipices of the upper cliffs project in horizontal\r\n     strata, yet have perpendicular rents. Some of the shattered masses\r\n     give the clearest echoes: we stood before one which responded every\r\n     syllable with an exactness which was truly astonishing.--There is\r\n     sometimes what may be called an amphitheatre of rock, where all the\r\n     area is filled with ruins, which are however covered with verdure\r\n     and underwood, that stretch up the sides with the wildest pomp: and\r\n     shelter here a cottage, there a villa, among the rocky hillocks.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPassing a gentleman\u0027s residence situated below the road on our left,\r\ncalled OLD PARK (not from its display of sylvan honors), we should look\r\nout for a romantic ascent in the lofty cliffs called ...\r\n\r\nCRIPPLE-PATH:\r\n\r\nIt is worth examining, being a curious instance of the formation of the\r\nbold horizontal crags and ledges which distinguish these hoary\r\nprecipices. For some distance the path is in a sunken stratum of soft\r\nfreestone, while the upper ledge of more stubborn rock overhangs it\r\nseveral feet. Having reached the eminence by a rude winding staircase in\r\na rent of the cliff,--we shall be well repaid for our trifling labor,\r\nby the beautiful prospect which is disclosed of the Undercliff, spread\r\nlike an extensive garden immediately under our feet. Many parties walk\r\nhence on the edge of the cliffs to Niton, \u0026c.\r\n\r\nMIRABLES is another charming villa, through whose luxuriant plantations\r\nthe road is carried for nearly half a mile, affording a most grateful\r\nshade: but, by the bye, at the expense of all prospect.\r\n\r\n    \"Refreshing change, where now the blazing sun?\r\n    By short transition we have lost his glare,\r\n    And stepp\u0027d at once into a cooler clime.\"\r\n\r\nThe house is secluded from our view: it is in the plain cottage style:\r\nbut the grounds are not surpassed for rock and sylvan beauty by any seat\r\non the coast.\r\n\r\nWe successively pass through the grounds, close and open, of the three\r\nfollowing villas:\r\n\r\nTHE ORCHARD (on the same side of the road as Mirables, and like it, not\r\nopen to the public view): a spacious villa in the embellished style, and\r\nthe grounds immediately in front being formed into a succession of\r\nwalled terraces, where the grape-vine and the peach find a congenial\r\naspect: the coping too is adorned with a profusion of elegant vases,\r\nfilled with the choicest flowers, nor is a gentle fountain wanting to\r\ncomplete the Italian beauty of the scene.\r\n\r\nBEAUCHAMP, an unpretending residence in the simple cottage style, on the\r\nright-hand side of the road, proceeding to Niton: we catch a glimpse of\r\nit through the trees.\r\n\r\nPUCKASTER COTTAGE, the property of the late James Vine, esq., remarkable\r\nfor its chaste and _appropriate_ design, _as a residence seated amidst\r\ncolossal rocks, precipices, and wild tufted knolls_. The house, the\r\nimprovements in the grounds, and every decoration, in character,--UNITY\r\nmarking the whole: rather an uncommon circumstance, where there is an\r\nunceasing desire to give every grace to a favorite scene--and withal,\r\nample scope and means to indulge the wish.\r\n\r\nThe old road now makes a sudden turn on our right, and here occurs the\r\nonly considerable break in the upper boundary line of the Undercliff\r\nfrom one end to the other. To the left of us, a considerable extent of\r\nland has been laid out and partly disposed of, for the purpose of\r\nbuilding on; and new roads made accordingly: but as yet however the\r\nspeculation has not been carried on with much spirit.\r\n\r\nAt a short distance we come in front of the garden-wall of a gentleman\u0027s\r\nvilla called WESTCLIFF, a beautiful and well-sheltered spot where the\r\nroad abruptly divides, the left-hand branch pursuing the tour to\r\nBlackgang Chine, and the right to Newport through NITON, a village\r\ncomposed of a number of stone-built thatched cottages, some of which are\r\nfurnished for lodgings; and has also a decent small inn called the White\r\nLion. The Church is a pretty little object enough, standing at the foot\r\nof the down, over which used to be the only direct high-road to Chale\r\nand Blackgang Chine.\r\n\r\nContinuing on towards the Chalybeate Spring, we pass Westcliff, and come\r\nto the ROYAL SANDROCK HOTEL, placed in a most beautiful and commanding\r\nsituation; it will be readily distinguished by its ample verandah,\r\nmantled with the choicest creepers.--Next to the Hotel appears MOUNT\r\nCLEEVES, a respectable residence near the foot of the cliff, surrounded\r\nby huge rocks and craggy mounds:--one of these is adorned by a small\r\nobelisk that serves to mark a beautiful feature which would otherwise be\r\noverlooked. The cottage-lodge below is a remarkably pretty object.--See\r\nthe Plate.\r\n\r\nThis part of the Undercliff is at once picturesque and lively; there\r\nbeing just sufficient houses to give the scenery a cheerful aspect,\r\nwithout intrenching too much on the natural beauties of the place.\r\n\r\nWe now enter on a scene which gives us a complete picture of the\r\nUndercliff in all its genuine lines,--for it was the subject of an\r\nextensive landslip in the year 1799, when a tract of about one hundred\r\nacres was disturbed, the whole sliding forward in a mass towards the\r\nsea, rifting into frightful chasms, and alternately rising and falling\r\nlike the waves of the sea: a cottage was overturned, but fortunately no\r\nlives were lost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE UNDERCLIFF, _Between the Sandrock Hotel \u0026 the\r\nChalybeate Spring,--affording the best idea of the romantic character of\r\nthat part of the Isle of Wight._]\r\n\r\nThe annexed Plate of \"the Undercliff, as it appears between the\r\nSandrock Hotel and Blackgang Chine,\" is introduced in order to give an\r\nidea of the _general aspect_ of this singular tract: the wall-like\r\nprecipice which is the land-boundary rises abruptly on the right: the\r\nintermediate space to the sea-shore is broken into a series of craggy\r\nknolls and dells: the carriage-road threading its way between immense\r\nmasses of the fallen cliff,--now conducted along the margin of a\r\ndangerous slope or precipice; and now descending into a theatre of\r\ndetached rocks and wild vegetation; but even here, though the softer\r\ncharms of scenery be wanting, it proves that ...\r\n\r\n                --\"Whether drest or rude,\r\n    Wild without art, or artfully subdued,\r\n    Nature in every form inspires delight.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\u003e\u003e _The individual objects in the neighbourhood of Niton, calling for\r\nparticular remark, are few; notwithstanding the general aspect of the\r\nscenery is strikingly wild and sombre.

CATHARINE\u0027S LIGHT-HOUSE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. CATHARINE\u0027S LIGHT-HOUSE NITON, ISLE OF WIGHT.]\r\n\r\nThe building of this lofty tower was commenced in the spring of 1839,\r\nand finished in the following year: the undertaking having originated in\r\nconsequence of the loss of the ship _Clarendon_ (see p. 85). From the\r\nfrequent wrecks on this most dangerous part of the coast, it is rather\r\nsurprizing that such a warning friend to the hapless mariner was not\r\nerected before: because many of the catastrophes were owing to the want\r\nof some light or signal in the night, which could be distinctly seen by\r\nseamen long ere they reached the fatal shore. It is true indeed, that\r\nbetween 50 and 60 years ago, a Light-house was built on the summit of\r\nSt. Catharine\u0027s down, but for some reason not known to the public, it\r\nnever was equipped and lighted: and was in fact very soon abandoned. It\r\nhas been said that the site was too elevated, that it would be quite\r\nobscured by fogs and mists in those very seasons when its friendly ray\r\nwas the most required;--it might be so, but certainly that was never\r\nproved by the experiment: and it seems strange that these grounds of\r\nobjection were not suggested to the projectors in time.\r\n\r\nThe new Light-house stands near the edge of the sea-cliffs, at an\r\nelevation of about fifty feet above the beach. The stone Tower is 101\r\nfeet high from the surface of the ground, besides the lantern of about\r\n20 feet more: and the foundation is of _solid masonry_ to the depth of\r\nthirty feet! The requisite offices for the two light-keepers are built\r\nround the foot of the tower, and are comparatively low, so that at a\r\ndistance the lofty fabric appears as a magnificent column, or\r\n\r\n    \"Like some tall watch-tower nodding o\u0027er the deep,\r\n    Whose rocky base the foaming waters sweep.\"\r\n\r\nInside the tower a broad stone staircase winds spirally to the top; and\r\nmany visitors make the ascent, for the sake of the beautiful view\r\nafforded of the adjacent part of the Undercliff, as well as for\r\nexamining the splendid and complicated lantern.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs the carriage-road now pursues its mazy course through ...\r\n\r\n    \"Crags, knolls, and mounds, confus\u0027dly hurl\u0027d,\r\n    The fragments of an earlier world,\"\r\n\r\nWe soon reach the locality of the SANDROCK CHALYBEATE SPRING: easily\r\nrecognized by the low thatched roof of the Dispensary Cottage, that\r\nstands nearly on the brow of the cliff, as the water issues from a rock\r\nconsiderably below, inclosed in a plain piece of masonry. It has been\r\nproved by repeated analyses, that there is a larger proportion of iron\r\nand alumine in this than in any other mineral water yet discovered: and\r\nits medicinal properties are therefore decidedly indicated in the cure\r\nof those disorders arising from a relaxed fibre and languid circulation,\r\nsuch as indigestion, flatulency, nervous disorders, and debility from a\r\nlong residence in hot climates.\r\n\r\nGreat improvement has taken place in the neighbourhood of the Spring,\r\nwithin these few years, by _extensive draining_: thus preventing the\r\nland-soaks and springs during winter from settling into frequent pools,\r\nand thereby reducing the soil to the repulsive condition of a sterile\r\nwaste of quagmire and sliding rocks, and in every succeeding summer\r\ndrying up into a thousand dangerous holes and fissures. The ground in\r\nfact is now sufficiently firm to invite the builder to the erection of\r\nsome good houses; and the surface exhibits a healthy herbage: roads have\r\nalso been made to the shore. A large and handsome-looking house, called\r\nan \"Italian Villa,\" has been erected on the east side of the\r\nSpring,--but if the architect ever copied such for his model, he\r\ncertainly should have selected a site more appropriate, that would have\r\njustified his choice of style by its genial aspect, its greenwood\r\nshades, and the vegetative luxuriance of the soil.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe shore here is called ROCKEN-END RACE, being composed of vast\r\nconfused heaps of rocky fragments precipitated in the course of ages\r\nfrom the cliffs above, and now stretching out into the sea for nearly a\r\nmile and a half.--Between this and Freshwater lie other formidable\r\nreefs, respectively named from the nearest villages, ATHERFIELD,\r\nCHILTON, and BROOKE; they are extremely dangerous: and previously to the\r\nerection of the new Light-house, occasioned frequent shipwrecks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACKGANG CHINE,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLACKGANG CHINE, I.W. _Taken from below the new Bridge,\r\nwhich is a very general point of view, as the descent to the shore\r\nthence becomes more abrupt and difficult._]\r\n\r\n    \"Where hills with naked heads the tempests meet--\r\n    Rocks at their sides, and torrents at their feet,\"\r\n\r\nDeservedly ranks among the most striking scenes in the island, it is the\r\ntermination of the Undercliff, and of a character the very reverse of\r\nShanklin; for all here is terrific grandeur--without a green spray or\r\nscarcely a tuft of verdure to soften its savage aspect. It differs also\r\nfrom that sylvan spot, in being much more lofty, abrupt, and irregular:\r\nthough it does not penetrate the land so far. Both have their respective\r\nadmirers: this for its awful sublimity--that for its romantic beauty.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the Chine is a spacious Hotel, close to the road, and\r\ndistinguished by the name of the place.\r\n\r\nThe shelving sides of this gloomy chasm are proved to be little less\r\nthan 500 feet from the beach in perpendicular height; they are in a\r\nconstant state of decay--more or less considerable according to the\r\ndegree of rain and frost during winter: for the same description of\r\nsoil, namely, a mixture of clay and loose absorbent marle, interspersed\r\nwith veins of gravel, predominate here as we have seen elsewhere in its\r\nneighbourhood. The only relief in fact to the dusky tint of the scene,\r\nis two or three horizontal strata of yellowish free-stone, which give it\r\na step-like appearance. The most remarkable feature is a tremendous\r\ngloomy hollow or cave, scooped out of the cliffs on the sea-shore by the\r\nunited action of the waves and the stream: the latter falls over a ledge\r\nof the stubborn rock at the top, 70 feet high: and after heavy floods,\r\nforms a noble cascade of one unbroken sheet: but like others of its\r\nclass, in summer fails in its amount, and often degenerates into a\r\nnoiseless dribble.\r\n\r\nNowhere can we get a complete view of Blackgang except off on the water,\r\nwhich is not always practicable: certainly not in the very seasons when\r\nthe whole appears with the greatest interest,--when there is a strong\r\nwind and tide setting in-shore, and the face of Nature is shrouded in\r\ndeepening gloom, with perhaps some hapless vessel in danger of being\r\nwrecked,--it is then dressed in all the congenial horrors of savage\r\nsublimity.--No one, a stranger to the sea-coast, would imagine how\r\nawfully the surges lash the stony beach in tempestuous weather: the\r\nhigh-curling waves break with a deafening roar, and mounting the lofty\r\ncliffs in sheets of dazzling foam, are wafted in misty clouds half over\r\nthe island--even to Newport, where the windows facing the south are\r\noccasionally dimmed with the saline vapors, almost to an incrustation.\r\n\r\nThe visitor will of course endeavour to descend to the shore; but this\r\nis sometimes attended with considerable fatigue and difficulty, after\r\nwet weather, to those who are delicate and infirm. For this reason, we\r\nhave taken our sketch from near the new bridge, to which the descent\r\nfrom the hotel is generally easy: and from which the visitor may gain\r\nsuch a view as will enable him to form a very good idea of the whole\r\nscene. The windings of the Chine commence a little below the Hotel,\r\nwhich (as already stated) stands at least 500 feet above the beach.\r\n\r\n     From the proximity of several newly erected villas and\r\n     lodging-houses, it ought here to be stated to the visitor, that the\r\n     _true character_ of the place is in consequence greatly injured:\r\n     for the garish and obtrusive habitations of genteel life but ill\r\n     accord with that solitary and impressive magnificence which\r\n     constitutes the very interest--the sublimity and peculiarity of a\r\n     silent and cheerless scene, such as formerly were the aspect and\r\n     condition of Blackgang Chine and its immediate neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n     \"There has long been a tradition that Blackgang Chine was once the\r\n     favorite retreat of a gang of pirates, and from that circumstance\r\n     its name was derived.--Without disputing the fact of its having\r\n     offered occasionally concealment and a safe depository to\r\n     smugglers, or even pirates for a time,--it is equally, if not more\r\n     probable, that it is indebted for its very expressive appellation\r\n     to its sombre coloring, and the _step-like_ appearance of the\r\n     strata, if the word _gang_ be admitted to have the same\r\n     signification as it has in a ship.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBetween Blackgang and Freshwater are several other Chines on an inferior\r\nscale, partaking more or less of the same sterile aspect: such are\r\nWalpan, Whale, Compton, Cowleaze and the Shepherd\u0027s, Grange, Chilton,\r\nand Brooke: but though several of them are well entitled to notice, they\r\nare seldom visited, owing to their remoteness from the public roads.\r\n\r\n     \u003e\u003e It should be observed however, that though they possess less\r\n     scenic interest than those already described,--they embrace a\r\n     portion of the island most attractive to the geologist, from the\r\n     circumstance of the cliffs and shores abounding in the most\r\n     beautiful specimens of fossil remains.--We would moreover call the\r\n     attention of those visitors who may desire to examine into the\r\n     agency which has produced the chines, to the two called _Cowleaze_\r\n     and _the Shepherd\u0027s_--the latter of which has been formed within\r\n     the last 40 years, in consequence, it is said, of a countryman in\r\n     an idle moment turning the course of the small rivulet which had\r\n     hitherto run through Cowleaze. They are situated about a mile from\r\n     Brixton.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nST. CATHARINE\u0027S HILL\r\n\r\n(In the steep side of which on the south is Blackgang Chine), is the\r\nhighest in the island, or between 800 and 900 feet above the level of\r\nthe sea. An ancient octagon tower stands at the top, built on the site\r\nof, or rather as an appendage to, a hermitage--originally endowed by a\r\nbenevolent individual for the purpose of providing lights in dark and\r\nstormy nights:--there is also the shell of the old light-house mentioned\r\nat p. 79.\r\n\r\nThe regular carriage-road between Chale and Niton used to be over this\r\ndown previous to the year 1838: and we in some measure regret (although\r\n_celerity_ in travelling be now the order of the day), that it is\r\nsuperseded by the road then made to Blackgang: to the admirers of\r\nillimitable prospect it afforded a rich treat, \"for language is scarcely\r\nadequate to describe the various beauties which present themselves from\r\nthis elevated spot.\"\r\n\r\nOn the northern extremity of St. Catharine\u0027s down is an elegant and most\r\nconspicuous object (72 feet high,) called the ALEXANDRIAN PILLAR: the\r\npurpose of its erection is perhaps best told by the inscription itself:\r\n\r\n     \"_In commemoration of the visit of his Imperial Majesty Alexander\r\n     I, Emperor of all the Russias, to Great Britain in the year\r\n     1814--and in remembrance of the many happy years\u0027 residence in his\r\n     dominions--this Pillar was erected by Michael Hoy._\"\r\n\r\nOn the slope is a seat called the MEDINA HERMITAGE (formerly the\r\nsummer-residence of the gentleman named on the pillar): the house is\r\ncharacterized by simplicity and neatness: and its greatest ornament is a\r\nlarge verandah, having a broad _trellis_ roof, beautifully intertwined\r\nwith the sweetest varieties of climbing plants. From its very elevated\r\nsituation, it commands a rich display of the country from Niton to\r\nNewport.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHALE CHURCH\r\n\r\nMust be passed in the regular tour, going to or returning from Blackgang;\r\nstands close to the road; and though simple in its architecture, has a\r\nvenerable and rather picturesque appearance--especially its square tower,\r\nwhich proves a great relief to the flatness of the view looking westward\r\nto the Freshwater cliffs: dates its erection in the 12th century; and\r\nexposed as it is to the rage of the elements, affords an instance of the\r\nstability which characterizes the structures of antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe cemetery of Chale incloses many a shipwrecked mariner--no doubt some\r\nhundreds who were deposited, in the course of ages, without any memento\r\nwhatever: but the public are now more interested, from the circumstance\r\nof the unfortunate sufferers in the wreck of the ship Clarendon being\r\nhere interred,--to whose memory tombstones are erected, on which the\r\ndate and other particulars of their melancholy fate are recorded.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     WRECKS ON THE SOUTHERN COAST.\r\n\r\n     We have already stated how dangerous this part of the coast is\r\n     during a south or south-west wind, to vessels unmanageable in a\r\n     storm: and previously to the erection of the new Light-house, few\r\n     winters passed without two or more wrecks occurring between Niton\r\n     and Freshwater Bay. In former times, the _waifs_, or possession of\r\n     such remains of ships or their cargoes as were washed ashore, seems\r\n     to have been a valued right of this, as well as some other manors\r\n     in the Isle of Wight; and many tales have been told of the\r\n     inhumanity of the wreckers who in those days are said to have\r\n     resided in the neighbourhood,--which, if true, are strongly\r\n     contrasted by the ready zeal and liberality which the present\r\n     inhabitants display in assisting those unfortunates whom the\r\n     furious elements so often cast on this fatal shore.\r\n\r\n     Of the numerous vessels which have been lost here in our own time,\r\n     the largest was perhaps the _Carn-brea Castle_ East Indiaman, in\r\n     July 1829: she left Spithead at nine o\u0027clock in the morning, and\r\n     about six hours afterwards struck on the rocks near Mottistone: the\r\n     weather being fine, her crew and passengers easily reached the\r\n     shore. The size of the ship, and the remarkable circumstances under\r\n     which she was lost, attracted a considerable number of visitors to\r\n     the spot,--as she was not immediately broken up, though all hopes\r\n     of removing her were soon abandoned.\r\n\r\n     A far more disastrous wreck was that of the CLARENDON, a West India\r\n     trader of 350 tons, which took place on the 11th of October, 1836:\r\n     and will be remembered with increased interest, as the acknowledged\r\n     fact of her loss being mainly attributable to the want of some\r\n     warning beacon on the land, led almost directly to the erection of\r\n     the splendid light-house at Niton. She had 11 passengers, male and\r\n     female, and 17 seamen on board: her cargo consisted of sugar, rum,\r\n     molasses, and turtle; she was heavily laden, and had been about six\r\n     weeks on her voyage. The preceding evening was fine, and the breeze\r\n     favorable, and the passengers retired to rest in fancied security,\r\n     with the pleasing hope of safely reaching their destination on the\r\n     following day. After midnight the wind increased; but though the\r\n     ship drove rapidly before it, no danger was perceived till about\r\n     day-break,--when, already in the surf, there was no longer a\r\n     possibility of escape. The crew immediately proceeded to set all\r\n     sail the storm would permit, in hopes of weathering the point; but\r\n     their gallant efforts could not long delay the fate of the doomed\r\n     vessel, she continued to drift towards the beach, on which she\r\n     struck a little before six o\u0027clock, and within five minutes was\r\n     totally demolished. It would be a useless attempt to describe the\r\n     horrors of that short but fearful period: all that could be\r\n     gathered from the statements of the survivors was, that she twice\r\n     touched the ground lightly, forward, at which time all her people\r\n     were assembled on the deck; and presently one mountain wave hurled\r\n     her broadside on the beach with such stupendous force, that the\r\n     huge hull at once parted into a thousand fragments! The frightful\r\n     brevity of the whole catastrophe prevented any measures being taken\r\n     for the relief of the passengers and crew, although the ship was\r\n     scarcely twice her own length from the cliff; and all perished\r\n     except the mate and two seamen, who were rescued by the courageous\r\n     exertions of some countrymen who had hastened to the spot as soon\r\n     as dawn disclosed the inevitable danger of the vessel.--For some\r\n     hours afterwards a hideous spectacle was here presented,--the naked\r\n     and mangled bodies of the unfortunate sufferers, with the remains\r\n     of the vessel and cargo, were tossed about in dire confusion by the\r\n     raging waves, or dashed again and again on the stony beach; but\r\n     before the close of the day, most of the former had been drawn\r\n     ashore, and the broken fragments of the wreck were strewed on the\r\n     beach for several miles. Six of the passengers (an officer named\r\n     Shore, his wife, and daughters,) were buried in Newport churchyard,\r\n     where a monument has since been erected to their memory; and it is\r\n     a strange fact that the premises which adjoin that cemetery on the\r\n     western side, had been but a short time previously engaged for\r\n     their reception by a near relative, who there anxiously awaited the\r\n     ship\u0027s arrival. Most of the others (as already mentioned,) were\r\n     interred at Chale.\r\n\r\n     Subsequently, the wrecks on the island coast have been less\r\n     numerous, and rarely accompanied by loss of life or any other\r\n     circumstance of particular interest: the case of H.M. Steam-sloop\r\n     SPHYNX, however, having excited so large a share of public\r\n     attention, claims a brief notice. Returning from her first voyage\r\n     to Africa, she neared the coast during a thick fog about six\r\n     o\u0027clock on the morning of Jan. 16, 1847: and by the force of her\r\n     engines was driven over the outer ledge (off Brooke), and firmly\r\n     fixed in the clay beds within. The suddenness of the accident\r\n     caused great alarm amongst her crew and passengers (300 in number):\r\n     and the startling discharges of her heavy artillery quickly aroused\r\n     the inhabitants for miles round: but daylight and the ebbing tide\r\n     enabled her people to reach land with no great\r\n     difficulty,--although a boat, sent to her from another war-steamer,\r\n     capsized with the loss of seven men. For nearly two months,\r\n     repeated efforts were made to extricate the Sphynx from her awkward\r\n     position: and after her masts, guns, and most of her stores and\r\n     machinery had been removed, and the hull itself buoyed up by a vast\r\n     number of empty casks, and some decked lighters (called camels),\r\n     she was at length brought off and towed into Portsmouth harbour on\r\n     the 3rd. of March. Her bottom had sustained considerable injury,\r\n     though much less than was expected from her having lain so long in\r\n     such a situation, and during several severe gales.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe VILLAGE OF CHALE lies at the foot of St. Catharine\u0027s Hill, and\r\ncomprises a considerable number of scattered cottages: none of them\r\nhowever deserving a stranger\u0027s notice, except perhaps the Parsonage, and\r\nthe Abbey-farm-house; the latter covered with the most luxuriant ivy.\r\n\r\nIf the visitor be on his return to Newport, he will within three miles\r\nof it pass GATCOMBE, a small village, and a first rate seat: exhibiting\r\naltogether perhaps the most charming _inland_ scenery in the Isle of\r\nWight:--\r\n\r\n    \"Sweet are its groves, and verdant are its fields.\"\r\n\r\nThe mansion is a large square edifice, extremely well-situated,--in\r\nfront a fine lawn falls with an easy slope, shaded by many noble oaks\r\nand elms: and immediately behind rises a steep hill luxuriantly clothed\r\nwith hanging plantations. At a short distance from the house is a small\r\nlake; and near the latter, the neat little parish-church, and the\r\nParsonage, both beautifully embosomed in wood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE ROAD TO FRESHWATER-GATE.\r\n\r\n\u003e\u003e _From Chale to the celebrated Cliff\u0027s of Freshwater is about twelve\r\nmiles; the first eight of which are through an agricultural district,\r\npresenting only so many agreeable pictures of rural life,--and of these\r\nthe principal are_ SHORWELL, NORTHCOURT, _and_ BRIXTON.\r\n\r\n    \"A simple scene! yet hence Brittannia sees\r\n    Her solid grandeur rise.\"\r\n\r\n     The fact is, the greater part of the soil is so extremely fertile,\r\n     as to be employed in tillage and meadow, almost to the exclusion of\r\n     woods and coppice, which constitute the chief ornaments of a\r\n     landscape. We have, however, nearly the whole of the journey such a\r\n     charming view of the ocean, as to compensate for the deficiency of\r\n     sylvan beauties.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter passing a small church called KINGSTON, posted on a knoll, and\r\nsurrounded by a few trees which bespeak their bleak exposure, we reach\r\n ...\r\n\r\nSHORWELL,\r\n\r\nA considerable village, about four miles from Chale, and five from\r\nNewport; it stands charmingly sheltered in a curve of the downs with a\r\nsouthern aspect; has a pretty church; and boasts of the finest old\r\nmansion in the island, called NORTHCOURT, built in the reign of James\r\nI. This venerable pile has lately been thoroughly repaired: a necessary\r\noperation by the bye that has stripped it for a few years of its\r\ngreatest ornament--the rich drapery of ivy which invested its lofty gray\r\nwalls and pinnacles: hills, clothed with hanging woods and plantations,\r\nrise boldly around it; many of the oaks and pines, luxuriating in a\r\nfertile soil and genial climate, are uncommonly fine: the grounds too\r\nare embellished with a rustic temple, and a very elegant mausoleum to\r\nthe memory of Miss Bull, the daughter of a former owner,--the whole\r\nscene indeed is replete with architectural and sylvan beauties. There\r\nare in the neighbourhood two other ancient manorial residences, named\r\nWestcourt and Woolverton, now converted into farm-houses: and the\r\ncottages of Shorwell are remarkable for their neatness and comfortable\r\nappearance, as well as for the abundant display of creepers and\r\nflowering shrubs with which most of them are adorned.\r\n\r\nTwo miles further on we enter BRIXTON, a populous village in the heart\r\nof a rich tract of cultivation: is one mile from the shore, and screened\r\nfrom the north by a range of lofty downs. The Church is rather spacious,\r\nand not unpicturesque; many of the cottages are neat, some few furnished\r\nfor lodgings: and there is a comfortable small inn. This place is\r\ncommonly called Brison, and one clergyman names it Brightstone.\r\n\r\nMOTTISTONE succeeds: a pretty hamlet nearly shrouded in wood, with a\r\nvery picturesque church. On an elevated part of the farm are the remains\r\nof some small druidical temple called LONGSTONE, which is a rude piece\r\nof rock of a quadrangular figure, evidently erected by art, and rears\r\nitself about twelve feet above the ground; near it another large stone\r\nlies partly buried in the earth, of not less than eight feet long.\r\n\r\nBROOK is the last village we pass till we reach Freshwater: much the\r\nsame character as the others: the Mansion-house, which is surrounded\r\nwith wood, being the only object to notice, besides the little church,\r\nwhich we shall presently pass, posted solitarily on an eminence near the\r\nfoot of the down.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE WESTERN QUARTER OF THE ISLAND, DISTINGUISHED\r\n\r\nFOR ITS\r\n\r\nSUBLIME SCENERY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Road over the Downs from Brooke to Freshwater-gate._\r\n\r\n     We shall now leave the familiar scenes of cultivation and of\r\n     village life for a time, to enjoy the charms of unbounded prospect,\r\n     as we journey for four miles over a succession of pasturing downs,\r\n     where in many parts our road will be upon a natural carpet of the\r\n     finest turf.\r\n\r\n     Tasteless indeed must be those who can travel over these lofty and\r\n     _beautiful_ downs, without experiencing the most lively\r\n     gratification from the checquered and magnificent prospects which\r\n     invite their contemplation on every side: but to enjoy the pleasure\r\n     in perfection we must occasionally pause, to discriminate (by\r\n     reference to a friend or a map,) some of the more remarkable\r\n     features.--Looking to the westward, the high cliffs of Freshwater\r\n     stretch away in a noble promontory of three miles, forming the\r\n     foreground to the soft azure perspective of the coast of Dorset:\r\n     but to the north, so diversified is the extensive landscape with\r\n     towns and villages, hills, woods, forests, sea, and river, as to\r\n     mock our most ardent wishes to convey even a faint idea of the\r\n     grandeur of the composition.\r\n\r\n     Another source of no inconsiderable pleasure, when traversing these\r\n     beautiful downs,--soaring as it were in the higher regions--is\r\n     feeling that we actually breathe the purest atmosphere, so\r\n     exhilarating to the human frame. Nor is the reverse of this\r\n     desirable clearness of the weather without its share of\r\n     amusement--to witness the formation of clouds, as the vapors are\r\n     drawn up from the sea, and gradually condensed; rolling by, and\r\n     enveloping us in their misty volumes. It is true indeed, that these\r\n     exhibitions are not without danger to the traveller, lest he\r\n     unwarily approach too near the fatal precipice: but this\r\n     circumstance imposing the necessity of caution, excites an\r\n     _interest_--and interest is the very zest of adventure. [Footnote:\r\n     Near the edge of the cliffs about half a mile eastward of\r\n     Freshwater-gate, a small tablet has lately been erected, to\r\n     commemorate the unfortunate fate of a youth who slipped over and\r\n     perished on the rocks beneath.--Some years ago two successive\r\n     keepers of the Needles Light-house lost their lives in a similar\r\n     manner over the precipices on which that establishment is located.]\r\n\r\n     In short, whether for the splendor of the prospects, the refreshing\r\n     purity of the air, or the novelty of literally walking in the\r\n     clouds, we esteem the journey over these downs, as pleasurable as\r\n     any portion of the tour.\r\n\r\nWe shall now suppose the Visitor to be descending the last down, and in\r\na few minutes, walking on the beach--here to commence his examination of\r\n ...\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRESHWATER CLIFFS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRESHWATER BAY, I.W. _(The two remarkable isolated Rocks\r\nand Entrance to the principal Cavern.)_]\r\n\r\n    \"Suspended cliffs, with hideous sway,\r\n    Seem nodding o\u0027er the caverns gray.\"\r\n\r\n\u003e\u003e_Several romantic_ CAVERNS _near Freshwater-gate: the Needles_\r\nLIGHT-HOUSE--_and the wonderfully_ COLORED SANDS _of Alum Bay, are\r\naccessible without taking boat: the celebrated_ NEEDLE ROCKS _are seen\r\n(though not to advantage,) from the down and beach: but the_ GRAND ARCH,\r\n_the_ WEDGE-ROCK, _and several deep_ CAVERNS _and other curiosities of\r\nRock-scenery, can be viewed only by water, which is extremely desirable\r\nin calm weather._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE CLIFFS OF ALBION is so favorite a poetical designation of the\r\nEnglish coast, that it is with some degree of pride we hail our\r\n\"sea-girt isle\" as surpassing in the magnificence and splendor of this\r\ncharacteristic, every other part of the kingdom; for even Shakspeare\u0027s\r\ncliff at Dover, immortalized as it is by the pen of the bard himself, is\r\nlittle more than half the elevation of some of the chalk precipices of\r\nthe Isle of Wight,--which, at Freshwater, rise from the bosom of the\r\nblue ocean with a perpendicular face of the most dazzling whiteness, the\r\nsublime altitude of more than 600 feet!--being nearly one-half higher\r\nthan the pinnacles either of St. Paul\u0027s or Salisbury Cathedrals.\r\n\r\nA stranger from the inland districts, who may never have seen a\r\nprecipice upon a grander scale than is presented by the sides of some\r\ndeep chalk-pit, would be at a loss to imagine wherein consisted the\r\nBEAUTY and the INTEREST of such seemingly monotonous scenes; especially\r\nwhen informed that they are indebted to no borrowed ornament from either\r\ntree or shrub: and indeed it would prove equally difficult on our part\r\nto furnish a comprehensive definition. One eminent writer\r\nenthusiastically eulogises their appearance as \"_singularly elegant_\r\nwhen viewed at a proper distance; and with the Needle Rocks,\r\nconstituting a whole that is scarcely to be equalled:\"--another declares\r\nthat \"the most lofty and magnificent fabrics of Art, compared with\r\nthese stupendous works of Nature, sink in idea to Lilliputian\r\nsize:\"--and a third, that \"the towering precipices of Scratchell\u0027s Bay\r\nare of the most elegant forms;\" and \"the pearly hue of the chalk is\r\nbeyond description by words, probably out of the power even of the\r\npencil.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs almost every visitor has a card of _all the local curiosities_\r\npresented to him by some of the boatmen of the place, it would be\r\nuseless here to describe individually the several objects deserving\r\npersonal observation: we shall therefore confine our notice to a few of\r\nthe most prominent,--commencing at ...\r\n\r\nFRESHWATER-GATE,\r\n\r\nRemarkable for the brilliancy as well as beauty of the surrounding\r\npromontories, of which an enchanting view is presented as we descend\r\nfrom the downs. The outline of the precipices is here extremely bold,\r\nforming several charming little coves or bays, and penetrated at the\r\nbase by numerous deep CAVERNS of the most romantic formation, that are\r\nexceedingly interesting to visitors when explored. But what contributes\r\nmost to the picturesque character of the scenery is the presence of\r\nseveral immense isolated rocks of grotesque shape, that rise from 30 to\r\n60 feet above the sea. Two of these will particularly attract attention,\r\nnamely, the _Arched_, and the _Deer-pound_, [Footnote: This name was\r\ngiven to the rock from the fact, it is said, of a deer having leaped on\r\nit from the main land, when closely pursued by the hounds of the late\r\nLord Holmes, about 70 or 80 years ago: at which time the separation\r\ncould have been but a few yards! Whatever credit may be attached to this\r\nanecdote by the reader, it at least serves to show the opinion which the\r\nolder inhabitants entertain of the progressive waste of land at this\r\npart of the coast (the face of the cliffs being constantly exposed to\r\nthe weather and undermining action of the sea); and we remember it was\r\nbut a few years back when the top of this same rock was covered with a\r\nconsiderable patch of green sod.] they are the remains of the original\r\ncliff, but being composed of more stubborn and adhesive materials, have\r\nlong resisted the lashing waves and warring elements, while the parent\r\ncliffs are constantly receding and forming a wider separation.\r\n\r\nHere are two respectable Hotels: the _Albion_, close to the beach; and\r\n_Plumbly\u0027s_, on the cliff: both of which offer to their guests the charm\r\nof hearing ...\r\n\r\n              ----\"The restless waves that roar,\r\n    And fling their foam against the rocky shore.\"\r\n\r\nThe CAVERN in Freshwater Bay was formerly an object of no little\r\ncuriosity to those who had never seen any thing similar of a more\r\nstriking character; but the romantic effect, and consequently interest\r\nof the scene has been greatly injured by the fall falling-in of the\r\narched roof. Now, however, visitors can easily investigate other caverns\r\nof a similar nature at WATCOMBE BAY (to which a good road has been made\r\nfrom Plumbly\u0027s Hotel,) where there is also a pyramidical rock, curiously\r\nperforated at the base.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \u003e\u003e A very common way of seeing these precipices is to go by water\r\n     to Alum Bay, there land, walk up to the Light-house, and return by\r\n     the beacon: or take boat at Alum Bay, and sail round the Needles or\r\n     to Freshwater Bay, just as fancy may suggest. Some proceed on foot\r\n     from Freshwater-gate to the Needles Light-house (about three\r\n     miles), on the green sod, near the margin of the cliffs: other\r\n     parties again go round by the carriage-road the whole distance in\r\n     their vehicles. As, however, the grandest scenes can only be\r\n     visited by boat, we shall best perform our duty as Cicerone by\r\n     pointing them out as they appear in an aquatic excursion--that to\r\n     parties generally affords a degree of elevated pleasure to which\r\n     nothing else in the island can bear any comparison. Yet should the\r\n     weather be too rough for this to be enjoyed, the visit to\r\n     Freshwater may prove not the less interesting: since it is\r\n     impossible for any spectacle to exceed in sublimity that which is\r\n     displayed when a storm is raging around the majestic cliffs and\r\n     vast detached rocks that here encounter the winds and waves of the\r\n     British Channel:--\r\n\r\n    \"Down bursts the gale--the surges sweep,\r\n    Like gathering hosts, against the steep,\r\n    Sheeting, with clouds of snowy spray,\r\n    Its lofty forehead, old and gray.\r\n    With sudden shriek and cowering wing,\r\n    To the wild cliff the sea-birds spring;\r\n    Careering o\u0027er the darken\u0027d heaven,\r\n    The clouds in warring heaps are driven;\r\n    And crested high with lawny foam,\r\n    Rushes the mighty billow home.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(Another Hotel is situated on the north side of the down, within sight\r\nof the Needles, by whose name it is distinguished.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATCOMBE BAY _FRESHWATER ISLE OF WIGHT._]\r\n\r\nFrom Watcombe Bay the precipices continue to increase in height till\r\nthey reach their greatest elevation (617 feet) at HIGH-DOWN, on which\r\nthe beacon is erected: they are however less perpendicular here than we\r\nshall presently find them; and the more sloping portions are covered by\r\nextensive patches of turf, samphire, \u0026c., which vary the pure white of\r\nthe upright masses, though perhaps the lofty appearance of the whole is\r\nthereby rather diminished, at least to a spectator at their base.\r\nAmongst the most remarkable objects in this part of the range are\r\nNEPTUNE\u0027S CAVE, and LORD HOLMES\u0027S PARLOUR:--the latter, a cavern of\r\nconsiderable height and breadth, derives its name from the nobleman,\r\nwhose name it bears, having occasionally enjoyed a repast with his\r\nfriends in the briny coolness of its shade, at least so tradition tells\r\nus: it can be easily entered by boat in calm weather: and when viewed\r\nfrom beneath its rough vaulted roof, has certainly a very romantic\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nA little further on is the WEDGE-ROCK, a most singular result of\r\naccident; being a piece of rock about twelve feet long by six or eight\r\nwide, exactly the shape of a wedge, resting between the main cliff and a\r\nlarge mass of detached chalk, just as if fixed there by some gigantic\r\nhand to effect the separation. It is often practicable to land here, and\r\nit is worth while on the part of the young and active, were it only to\r\nbe satisfied how extremely deceptive is the appearance of the rocks and\r\nbroken green ledges, as to their size and extent of surface,--for few\r\nwould suppose (in passing by,) that the piece near the Wedge-rock\r\ncontains upwards of an acre of ground.--The pyramidical mass connected\r\nwith the Wedge is about fifty feet high, and a hundred long at the base.\r\n\r\n     Our friends will remember (as has been before said,) that we leave\r\n     the history of many curious rocks and caverns to be given by the\r\n     local watermen; for personal examination will invest a scene or\r\n     object with a degree of interest which cannot be felt by the\r\n     reader, who may have no expectation of ever seeing them.\r\n\r\nPassing the OLD PEPPER-ROCK, a picturesque detached mass at the foot of\r\nthe chalk--we find ourselves under the noble promontory of MAIN-BENCH,\r\nwhere the precipices again rise to upwards, of six hundred feet in\r\nheight: and being nearly perpendicular, present a truly sublime aspect,\r\nviewed either from above or below: while the constant washing of the\r\nwaves at the lower part, by removing the looser particles of chalk,\r\ngives it much the appearance of having been built with vast blocks of\r\nmasonry. As the water is deep even close to the cliff, and beautifully\r\ntransparent in calm weather, the reflection on its surface of the crags\r\nabove, and the sunken rocks and marine plants which appear beneath, must\r\nadd considerably to the interest of our aquatic excursion. Main-bench\r\nterminates in a bold bluff or projecting angle called SUN CORNER;\r\nrounding which, we enter ...\r\n\r\nSCRATCHELL\u0027S BAY, universally considered by visitors as the most\r\nmemorable spot on the island coast, alike for the grandeur, beauty, and\r\nvariety of its scenery. The dazzling whiteness of the chalk is here\r\nrelieved by thin curving beds of dark flint, which regularly divide it\r\ninto parallel strata of eight or ten feet thickness; the towering\r\nprecipices are of the most picturesque shapes; and the Needle Rocks form\r\nan inimitable termination to the scene. Just within the bay is the\r\nNEEDLES CAVE, the deepest along the whole range, as it penetrates the\r\nchalk 300 feet: but the _unique_ feature which above all the rest claims\r\nattention is the niche-like recess in the face of the cliff,\r\nappropriately designated ...\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND ARCH;\r\n\r\nIt indicates little that is remarkable at a distance; but a truly\r\nsublime effect is produced when the stranger is placed under its awful\r\nroof with his back against the concave chalk: for he then sees above him\r\na magnificent Arch two hundred feet in height and overhanging the beach\r\nat least one hundred and eighty!--yet so true, nay, even elegant is the\r\nsweep, that it rather resembles the stupendous work of Art, than the\r\ncasual production of Nature. To form an idea of the sublimity of the\r\nscene, the reader should task his memory with the dimensions of some of\r\nthe proudest architectural monuments in Great Britain: and the\r\ncomparison would immediately remove all doubt, that a sight of the Arch\r\nitself would amply repay the trouble of a visit to Freshwater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCRATCHELL\u0027S BAY, _And the NEEDLE ROCKS, as viewed from a\r\nbold Bluff called Sun Corner, being the termination of the Freshwater\r\nCliffs.--Isle if Wight._]\r\n\r\nScratchell\u0027s Bay is about half-a-mile in breadth; being formed by Sun\r\nCorner and the Grand Arch on the eastern side, and on the west by the\r\n\r\nNEEDLE ROCKS,\r\n\r\nWhich stretch out into the sea a considerable distance: they are remains\r\nof the original cliff, and forcibly illustrate the destructive power of\r\nthe ocean\u0027s stormy winds and waves, which in successive ages have\r\nremoved so vast a quantity of the adjacent chalk. Nor are their ravages\r\nat all diminished at the present time: for it is only within the last\r\nfew years that the smallest rock has been completely insulated; while\r\nanother immense mass of the cliff is evidently separating by degrees,\r\nand will probably become ere long entirely detached, forming a\r\nmagnificent pyramid two or three hundred feet high. It is impossible to\r\nconvey by verbal description a correct idea of these celebrated rocks:\r\nfor in passing round or through them, they assume a different shape\r\nalmost every dozen yards; sometimes appearing like a continuation of the\r\nmain promontory,--sometimes as one or more lofty acuminated\r\npyramids,--or again we see the different masses extending in nearly a\r\nstraight line, between which we catch a distant view of Christchurch and\r\nother objects on the opposite coast. The name (inappropriate to their\r\npresent form,) was derived from a spiry rock, 120 feet high and very\r\nslender, which fell in the year 1764, having been nearly worn through by\r\nthe incessant action of the tides: its base however is still visible at\r\nlow water.\r\n\r\n     The _Pomone_, a fifty-gun frigate, was wrecked on the most western\r\n     of these rocks, on June 11th, 1811, when returning home after an\r\n     absence of three years; but owing to the fineness of the weather,\r\n     the crew and passengers, including some Persian princes, reached\r\n     the shore in safety; and most of her guns and stores were removed\r\n     before she went to pieces. \"The vessel,\" says Mr. Webster,\r\n     \"afforded me a scale by which to judge of the size of the Needles,\r\n     and I was surprized to find that the hull of the frigate did not\r\n     reach one-fourth of their height.\" The entrance to the Solent\r\n     Channel \"through the Needles\" was always considered hazardous for\r\n     ships of great burthen, not only on account of those rocks, but\r\n     also of the immense banks of pebbles or \"Shingles\" that lie to the\r\n     westward: recent surveys have however ascertained that the channel\r\n     has sufficient width and depth for the safe passage of the largest\r\n     ships of war.\r\n\r\nALUM BAY.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant and novel display of rock scenery which this spot affords,\r\nand its being easily accessible either by water or land (for a road\r\nleads to it from the north side of the down), cause it to be universally\r\nvisited by strangers who extend their tour to this quarter of the\r\nisland. It is bounded on the south by the Needles and the snowy\r\nprecipices of which they once formed part: but its greatest celebrity is\r\nowing to the wonderful diversity and brightness in the cliffs on the\r\nopposite side, which are composed of sand, clay, and ochreous earths,\r\ndisposed in alternate _vertical_ strata: and as the torrents of winter\r\ncarry away vast masses of the soil, forming numerous deep ravines--an\r\nendless variety of the most beautiful peaks and romantic forms are thus\r\nproduced. The colored strata vary in thickness from a sheet of paper to\r\nseveral yards; are now purely white, black, red, or yellow; then brown,\r\nblueish, or dull green,--alternating in a surprizing manner with each\r\nother, or blending into every hue: and many of the tints so vivid, yet\r\nso delicate, that they are justly compared to the variegations of a\r\ntulip, or to the shades of silk. \"Alum Bay,\" says an eminent geologist,\r\n\"is so extraordinary a place, that I am unable to explain in adequate\r\nterms, the surprize I felt on first seeing it. The scenery is indeed of\r\na species unique in this country: and nothing that I had previously seen\r\nbore the least resemblance to it.\" This spot owes its name to the fact\r\nof alum having been occasionally found on its shores.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now, having pointed out the most remarkable features in the cliffs,\r\nit only remains to notice THE LIGHT-HOUSE, which is a gratifying object\r\nof curiosity to persons unacquainted with the nature of such an\r\nestablishment, it stands near the extremity of the down, and commands a\r\nprospect of great extent and beauty, particularly of the unrivaled\r\nscenery of Alum Bay. The Needles are seen to most advantage from the\r\nwater: but when this has not been enjoyed, the party should cautiously\r\napproach within a few yards of the precipice, \"and to those whose nerves\r\nare proof against the horrors of the position, the new into the bays\r\nbeneath, and of the cliffs and Needle Rocks, is extremely sublime. The\r\nagitation and sound of the waves below are hardly perceived, and it is\r\nscarcely possible to imagine that the quiet expanse which now seems\r\nstretched in boundless repose under the eye, is the same turbulent\r\nelement which had but lately been seen bursting in clouds of foam, and\r\nthundering on its rocky shore.--In hard blowing weather, the fury of the\r\nwind on this promontory is scarcely credible. Very large flints and\r\nfragments of chalk are blown from the cliffs, so as to endanger the\r\nwindows of the light-house; and for many days in succession, it is\r\nscarcely possible to open the door.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The precipices of Freshwater, like those at Bembridge, are\r\n     frequented at periodical seasons by prodigious flights of sea-fowl\r\n     of various kinds. The birds are taken by the country-people at the\r\n     hazard of their lives; they descend by means of a stout rope which\r\n     turns round a crow-bar firmly fixed in the ground above; one end of\r\n     the rope being fastened about their body, and the other end held in\r\n     their hands, by which they lower and raise themselves from ledge to\r\n     ledge of the horrid precipice. The aquatic fowl furnish most\r\n     amusing sport to numberless shooting-parties during the season. The\r\n     principal species are ... puffins, gulls, cormorants, Cornish\r\n     choughs, the eider duck, auks, divers, guillemots, razor-bills,\r\n     widgeons, willocks, daws, starlings, and pigeons. Their\r\n     breeding-season is in the months of May, June, and July, and\r\n     towards the end of August the greater part of them migrate with\r\n     their new generations. Their flesh is too rank and fishy to be\r\n     eaten, and is used only for baiting crab and lobster pots; the\r\n     feathers are valuable, and the eggs are bought chiefly by visitors\r\n     for curiosity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE ROADS TO YARMOUTH, NEWPORT, \u0026c.\r\n\r\n\u003e\u003e _Having visited the western extremity of the Island, we\r\nreturn--either by_ CALBOURNE _to Newport, which is the nearest; or round\r\nby_ YARMOUTH, _this being perhaps the less monotonous road of the two._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe tourist, on leaving the magnificent scenes of the western coast, can\r\nhardly expect to see many spots in the remainder of his journey, capable\r\nof engaging his attention. He may still however enjoy some very charming\r\nprospects, particularly in the neighbourhood of Yarmouth, whither we\r\nshall now suppose him to shape his course.\r\n\r\nWe shall pass two seats: FARRINGFORD, on the north side of the down,\r\nsurrounded by flourishing plantations; and about a mile and a half\r\nfurther, the fine old manor-house of AFTON.\r\n\r\nTHE VILLAGE OF FRESHWATER is prettily interspersed with wood; but except\r\nthe church (whose front is more picturesque than most in the island),\r\nhas nothing to notice;--unless it should fortunately happen to be\r\nhigh-tide at the time of our passing, and then the RIVER YAR will have a\r\nlovely effect--winding between gently rising banks feathered with grove\r\nand copse, shrouding here a mansion, and there a cottage; while\r\npleasure-boats and an unusual number of swans are seen gliding and\r\nsporting on its silver bosom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPassing over a neat bridge, and through the fertile parish of THORLEY,\r\nwhose church is the plainest in the island, we reach\r\n\r\nYARMOUTH,\r\n\r\nStanding opposite Lymington, and once a place of considerable\r\nimportance, having obtained a charter of franchises in the reign of\r\nHenry II: it is very clean and open,--and being situated in the\r\nneighbourhood of the most interesting coast scenery, is upon the whole\r\nan agreeable place, particularly for gentlemen partial to marine\r\npleasures. Its chief support is derived from the shipping that anchor in\r\nits excellent roadsted, and the passengers to and from Lymington; there\r\nare three inns--the principal one (the George,) is a large ancient\r\nbuilding, formerly the Governor\u0027s house, where King Charles II was\r\nentertained by Sir Rt. Holmes on his paying the island a visit in\r\n1667.--The Church has recently received the ornament of a new tower, and\r\nthe interior boasts a good statue of the above-named Sir Robert. The\r\nCastle (as it is called), is a heavy, plain mass of building,\r\nconstructed in the reign of Henry VIII to protect this entrance to the\r\nSolent Channel.\r\n\r\nThe village of NORTON is on the opposite side of the river, where there\r\nare several very respectable villas,--so sheltered by groves and\r\nshrubberies, that the whole neighbourhood presents the delightful\r\nappearance of a bold foreland completely shrouded in wood, even to the\r\nwater\u0027s edge.\r\n\r\n     Opposite _Carey\u0027s Sconce_, half a mile west of Norton, is HURST\r\n     CASTLE, built at the extremity of a long strip of shingly land\r\n     stretching out from the Hampshire coast, which here contracts the\r\n     width of the Solent Channel to less than a mile. Close by are two\r\n     Light-houses, erected for the purpose of assisting ships to clear\r\n     the passage through the Needles.\r\n\r\nFour miles from Yarmouth we pass through SHALFLEET, a clean and populous\r\nvillage: the Church is next the road, of a heavy construction,--yet\r\naffording a good subject for a sketch. Northward is NEWTOWN, a very\r\nancient borough; which was a populous place in the time of Richard II\r\n(when it was burned by the French, but soon afterwards rebuilt), and\r\nthough now reduced to a few humble cottages, the course of its streets\r\nmay yet be traced. It has a new church, of a neat design; and is noted\r\nfor its extensive salterns, and convenient haven.--Previously to the\r\npassing of the Reform Bill in 1832, Yarmouth and Newtown each returned\r\ntwo members to parliament.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Road by Calbourne and Carisbrooke._\r\n\r\nThe direct road from Freshwater-gate to Newport runs for the first three\r\nor four miles at the northern foot of the range of downs described at p.\r\n89; presenting no object worthy of separate remark till we reach\r\nCALBOURNE, a considerable village, having a decent small inn. The pretty\r\nsituation of its neat little Church and Parsonage,--the handsome mansion\r\nand luxuriant plantations of a first-rate seat called WESTOVER, close\r\nby,--with a small stream running through the grounds and in front of the\r\nneighbouring cottages,--altogether produce a very pleasing scene ...\r\n\r\n    \"Where sweet simplicity resides, which Grace\r\n    And Beauty call their own.\"\r\n\r\nTwo miles further we pass SWAINSTON, another principal seat: the mansion\r\nlies below the road, surrounded by trees; a copious stream, well stored\r\nwith fish, runs through the gardens and plantations, which are extensive\r\nand judiciously laid-out; and the prospect-temple which crowns the hill\r\non the right is a very conspicuous object. From hence the road is on\r\nthe slope of a series of hills, often picturesquely shrouded in groves\r\nand hanging woods; while in the more open parts some extensive views are\r\npresented of the north side of the island, the sea, and the opposite\r\ncoast of Hampshire; but the prospect which is opened as we descend into\r\nCarisbrooke is particularly grand: the village makes an admirable\r\nforeground, backed by lofty hills,--on the left we see the town of\r\nNewport and its adjoining hamlets, with E. Cowes Park, \u0026c. in the\r\ndistance,--and on the right,\r\n\r\n    \"High o\u0027er the pines, that with their dark\u0027ning shade\r\n      Surround yon craggy bank, THE CASTLE rears\r\n    Its crumbling turrets: still its towering head\r\n      A warlike mien, a sullen grandeur wears!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLANDMARKS AND OTHER CONSPICUOUS OBJECTS\r\n\r\n_Erected on the Hills._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fact of so many of the hills and downs being crowned with some\r\nfar-seen object, such as a light-house, obelisk, or telegraph, must be a\r\nsource of considerable interest to a traveller in the Isle of Wight, not\r\nonly by their often giving an identity and attraction to many of those\r\nbroad features of scenery which would otherwise be comparatively tame\r\nand monotonous, but also by enabling him to determine the bearings and\r\nsituation of places in their vicinity.\r\n\r\n     We shall here name a few of the most conspicuous of these objects,\r\n     nearly in the order pursued in the preceding description of the\r\n     Tour of the Island:--most of them being visible from the\r\n     neighbourhood of Newport, which, as we have before stated, occupies\r\n     a central position. We shall therefore commence with Carisbrooke\r\n     Castle.\r\n\r\n     At West Cowes--the Church-tower, and Windmills. At East\r\n     Cowes--Towers of Osborne, Norris, and East Cowes Castle. At\r\n     Wootton--the Prospect-tower of Fernhill. Southward of Ryde--a large\r\n     Windmill. On Ashey Down--the Sea-mark. At Bembridge--Mill on the\r\n     Down. Godshill--the Church: behind which, on Appuldurcombe Down, is\r\n     an Obelisk and private Signal-station. On Shanklin Down--Cooke\u0027s\r\n     Castle. St. Catharine\u0027s Down--ancient Tower, and old Light-house;\r\n     on the sea-cliffs, the new Light-house; on the northern extremity\r\n     of the down, the Alexandrian Pillar. Freshwater Downs--Light-house,\r\n     and Beacon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTOURS OF THE ISLAND.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Some years ago it was customary for the then limited number of\r\n     Post-masters to adopt a regular three-days\u0027 Tour of the island,\r\n     dividing it into the North-eastern, the Southern, and the\r\n     North-western; differing but very little except as to the _order_\r\n     of the days\u0027 excursion. Not so now--for a hundred plans would\r\n     hardly describe all \"the Tours\" recommended by the different\r\n     inn-keepers and numerous other letters-out of vehicles for\r\n     pleasure-parties; to say nothing of the wide difference between the\r\n     visitors themselves, as regards the _Time_ allowed.--We have\r\n     anticipated, we hope, every question on the subject, by the\r\n     arrangement in the preceding pages: but still it may be\r\n     satisfactory to some of our readers, to see the most generally\r\n     adopted Routes.

Steamers perform the trip two or three times a-week\r\nduring the season (usually in about eight hours): and sailing-craft from\r\nRyde and Cowes are often engaged by parties for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIf we sail to the eastward on leaving Cowes Harbour, the first objects\r\ndemanding our attention are Norris Castle and the royal Palace of\r\nOsborne, with their extensive lawns sweeping to the shore, shaded by\r\nnumerous groups of noble trees. After passing the Creeks of King\u0027s Quay\r\nand Wootton, we have a partial sight of Binstead: and a most\r\ncomprehensive view of the fashionable town of Ryde, just as we leave the\r\nPier. Hence to St. Helen\u0027s the coast forms several beautiful bays, lined\r\nwith gentlemen\u0027s seats and villas, hamlets, and luxuriant woods.\r\n\r\nBrading Haven, with the adjacent villages of Bembridge, St. Helen\u0027s, and\r\nBrading,--the whole encompassed by a semi-circular range of lofty\r\nhills--forms a very agreeable picture, especially at the time of high\r\nwater. Our readers will have no difficulty in recognising the landmark\r\nof St. Helen\u0027s tower on the beach, and that on Ashey Down, about four\r\nmiles inland.\r\n\r\nTwo miles further are the lofty Culver Cliffs, forming the north side of\r\nSandown Bay, on whose shores stand the village and fort of the same\r\nname. At the southern extremity of this extensive bay rise the dark\r\nprecipices of Dunnose, penetrated by the Chines of Shanklin and\r\nLuccombe. Near the latter commences the celebrated tract called the\r\nUndercliff, whose varied and unique charms are nowhere so advantageously\r\nseen as from the water, \"whence it rises like a series of gigantic steps\r\nthat seem to lead from the lofty cliffs on the shore, to the summit of\r\nthe grand perpendicular wall\" that bounds it on the land-side.--East\r\nEnd, the lovely village of Bonchurch, the fast-increasing town of\r\nVentnor, and the stately castle of Steephill, are all fully presented to\r\nour view: and less distinctly through the groves in which they are for\r\nthe most part embosomed, the villas of St. Lawrence, Old Park, Mirables,\r\n\u0026c. Beyond the pretty little cove of Puckaster we see part of Niton\r\nvillage; and close to the shore, the gigantic tower of the Light-house.\r\nA mile further is the Sandrock Spring, in the midst of a wild tract,\r\nthat terminates in the gloomy ravine called Blackgang Chine, backed by\r\nthe tower-crowned eminence of St. Catharine\u0027s Hill.\r\n\r\nHence to Compton Bay the coast is dreary and comparatively monotonous;\r\nbut we have a tolerable view of some of the smaller chines, and also of\r\nthe fine range of downs that stretch from the centre of the island to\r\nits western extremity. Almost the whole extent of Freshwater Cliffs\r\nmeets the eye at once: but there is no great difficulty in recognizing\r\nthe most noted rocks, caves, \u0026c. as we pass along. The various forms\r\nwhich are exhibited by those huge masses of chalk the Needles, as we\r\napproach and leave them, in connection with the beautiful precipices of\r\nScratchell\u0027s Bay, form perhaps the most interesting circumstance of our\r\nvoyage: the light-house seems placed on the very brink of the precipice:\r\nand the brilliant scenery of Alum Bay will appear to advantage,\r\nespecially if it be a sunny afternoon.\r\n\r\nBeyond this the coast consists of steep broken slopes and earthy cliffs,\r\nsome of them of considerable altitude, but presents no object of\r\nparticular interest till we near the river Yar, with its adjacent town\r\nand villas: Newtown Creek opens about three miles further on. West\r\nCowes, as we approach it from Thorness Bay, has a beautiful aspect,\r\nnumerous genteel villas and first-rate lodging-houses covering the shore\r\nfor nearly a mile: and the ever-amusing scene of Cowes harbour will form\r\na delightful termination to our voyage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Passage and Conveyance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJUNE 1, 1849.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBY STEAM-PACKETS.\r\n\r\n     \u003e\u003e_Strangers are particularly requested to attend to the following\r\n     recommendation._--We have always made it a point to delay the\r\n     publication of our Guides to as late a period as we well could\r\n     (often to a degree of inconvenience), in order that our readers may\r\n     be furnished with an accurate statement of the precise time of the\r\n     several passage-vessels starting to or from the island: but this,\r\n     instead of an advantage, often proved a disappointment: for perhaps\r\n     a change of hours unexpectedly took place within a week or\r\n     fortnight afterwards, in consequence of some new regulation in the\r\n     time of the railways, or from some motive on the part of one or\r\n     other of the steam-packet companies. We therefore particularly\r\n     advise strangers to make inquiry at the local inns, on board the\r\n     packets, or at the railway or booking offices, in all cases where\r\n     it is of important consequence to know exactly to a minute.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Between Southampton, Cowes, Ryde, \u0026 Portsmouth._\r\n\r\n    FROM MORN.

If from Ryde in the morning, they would be returned to Cowes in\r\ntime for the last packet across, and the same from the latter to the\r\nformer place.\r\n\r\n     But here we must caution our friends, as we did respecting the\r\n     steam-packets, that frequent alterations take place in the hours of\r\n     starting, perhaps in consequence of some change made by the\r\n     vessels, but as often induced by the caprice of the rival\r\n     speculators; some of them continuing throughout the year, and\r\n     others running only during the summer.\r\n\r\nThe CARRIERS.--These of late have so increased, that there is scarcely a\r\nvillage without one or more to Newport or Ryde,--between the latter\r\nplaces there are three every day; between Cowes, Newport, and Ventnor,\r\nseveral carts and vans daily; and from the less populous parishes, one\r\nevery other day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nList of the Principal Inns.\r\n\r\nNEWPORT,--the Bugle--Mew.\r\n          Star--Bryant.\r\n          Wheat-sheaf, Corn-market--J.
