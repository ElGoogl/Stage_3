In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\r\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.

For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.",

The lectures were repeated in the following month of June at\r\nPortland, Oregon, and since then either the whole course, or one or more\r\nof the lectures, have been given in Boston, Newton, Milton, Chelsea,\r\nNew Bedford, Lowell, Worcester, Springfield, and Pittsfield, Mass.;\r\nFarmington, Middletown, and Stamford, Conn.; New York, Brooklyn, and\r\nTarrytown, N.Y.; Philadelphia and Ogontz, Pa.; Wilmington, Del.;\r\nChicago, 111.; San Francisco and Oakland, Cal.\r\n\r\nIn this sketch of the circumstances which attended the settlement of New\r\nEngland, I have purposely omitted many details which in a formal history\r\nof that period would need to be included. It has been my aim to give the\r\noutline of such a narrative as to indicate the principles at work in\r\nthe history of New England down to the Revolution of 1689. When I was\r\nwriting the lectures I had just been reading, with much interest, the\r\nwork of my former pupil, Mr. Brooks Adams, entitled \"The Emancipation of\r\nMassachusetts.\"\r\n\r\nWith the specific conclusions set forth in that book I found myself\r\noften agreeing, but it seemed to me that the general aspect of the case\r\nwould be considerably modified and perhaps somewhat more adequately\r\npresented by enlarging the field of view. In forming historical\r\njudgments a great deal depends upon our perspective. Out of the very\r\nimperfect human nature which is so slowly and painfully casting off the\r\noriginal sin of its inheritance from primeval savagery, it is scarcely\r\npossible in any age to get a result which will look quite satisfactory\r\nto the men of a riper and more enlightened age. Fortunately we can learn\r\nsomething from the stumblings of our forefathers, and a good many\r\nthings seem quite clear to us to-day which two centuries ago were only\r\nbeginning to be dimly discerned by a few of the keenest and boldest\r\nspirits. The faults of the Puritan theocracy, which found its most\r\ncomplete development in Massachusetts, are so glaring that it is idle to\r\nseek to palliate them or to explain them away. But if we would really\r\nunderstand what was going on in the Puritan world of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, and how a better state of things has grown out of it, we must\r\nendeavour to distinguish and define the elements of wholesome strength\r\nin that theocracy no less than its elements of crudity and weakness.\r\n\r\nThe first chapter, on \"The Roman Idea and the English Idea,\" contains a\r\nsomewhat more developed statement of the points briefly indicated in the\r\nthirteenth section (pp. 85-95) of \"The Destiny of Man.\" As all of the\r\npresent book, except the first chapter, was written here under the\r\nshadow of the Washington University, I take pleasure in dating it from\r\nthis charming and hospitable city where I have passed some of the most\r\ndelightful hours of my life.\r\n\r\nSt. Louis, April 15, 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE ROMAN IDEA AND THE ENGLISH IDEA.\r\n\r\nWhen did the Roman Empire come to an end? ... 1-3\r\n\r\nMeaning of Odovakar\u0027s work ... 3\r\n\r\nThe Holy Roman Empire ... 4, 5\r\n\r\nGradual shifting of primacy from the men who spoke Latin, and their\r\ndescendants, to the men who speak English ... 6-8\r\n\r\nPolitical history is the history of nation-making ... 8, 9\r\n\r\nThe ORIENTAL method of nation-making; _conquest without incorporation_\r\n... 9\r\n\r\nIllustrations from eastern despotisms ... 10\r\n\r\nAnd from the Moors in Spain ... 11\r\n\r\nThe ROMAN method of nation-making; _conquest with incorporation, but\r\nwithout representation_ ... 12\r\n\r\nIts slow development ... 13\r\n\r\nVices in the Roman system. ... 14\r\n\r\nIts fundamental defect ... 15\r\n\r\nIt knew nothing of political power delegated by the people to\r\nrepresentatives ... 16\r\n\r\nAnd therefore the expansion of its dominion ended in a centralized\r\nDespotism ... 16\r\n\r\nWhich entailed the danger that human life might come to stagnate in\r\nEurope, as it had done in Asia ... 17\r\n\r\nThe danger was warded off by the Germanic invasions, which, however,\r\nthreatened to undo the work which the Empire had done in organizing\r\nEuropean society ... 17\r\n\r\nBut such disintegration was prevented by the sway which the Roman Church\r\nhad come to exercise over the European mind ... 18\r\n\r\nThe wonderful thirteenth century ... 19\r\n\r\nThe ENGLISH method of nation-making;

It was\r\nin that year that the soldier of fortune, Odovakar, commander of the\r\nHerulian mercenaries in Italy, sent the handsome boy Romulus, son of\r\nOrestes, better known as \"little Augustus,\" from his imperial throne\r\nto the splendid villa of Lucullus near Naples, and gave him a yearly\r\npension of $35,000 [6,000 solidi] to console him for the loss of a\r\nworld. As 324 years elapsed before another emperor was crowned at Rome,\r\nand as the political headship of Europe after that happy restoration\r\nremained upon the German soil to which the events of the eighth century\r\nhad shifted it, nothing could seem more natural than the habit which\r\nhistorians once had, of saying that the mighty career of Rome had ended,\r\nas it had begun, with a Romulus. Sometimes the date 476 was even set up\r\nas a great landmark dividing modern from ancient history. For those,\r\nhowever, who took such a view, it was impossible to see the events of\r\nthe Middle Ages in their true relations to what went before and what\r\ncame after. It was impossible to understand what went on in Italy in\r\nthe sixth century, or to explain the position of that great Roman power\r\nwhich had its centre on the Bosphorus, which in the code of Justinian\r\nleft us our grandest monument of Roman law, and which for a thousand\r\nyears was the staunch bulwark of Europe against the successive\r\naggressions of Persian, Saracen, and Turk. It was equally impossible to\r\nunderstand the rise of the Papal power, the all-important politics of\r\nthe great Saxon and Swabian emperors, the relations of mediaeval England\r\nto the Continental powers, or the marvellously interesting growth of the\r\nmodern European system of nationalities. [Sidenote: When did the Roman\r\nEmpire come to an end?]\r\n\r\nSince the middle of the nineteenth century the study of history has\r\nundergone changes no less sweeping than those which have in the same\r\ntime affected the study of the physical sciences. Vast groups of facts\r\ndistributed through various ages and countries have been subjected to\r\ncomparison and analysis, with the result that they have not only thrown\r\nfresh light upon one another, but have in many cases enabled us to\r\nrecover historic points of view that had long been buried in oblivion.\r\nSuch an instance was furnished about twenty-five years ago by Dr.\r\nBryce\u0027s epoch-making work on the Holy Roman Empire. Since then\r\nhistorians still recognize the importance of the date 476 as that which\r\nleft the Bishop of Rome the dominant personage in Italy, and marked the\r\nshifting of the political centre of gravity from the Palatine to the\r\nLateran. This was one of those subtle changes which escape notice until\r\nafter some of their effects have attracted attention. The most important\r\neffect, in this instance, realized after three centuries, was not the\r\noverthrow of Roman power in the West, but its indefinite extension and\r\nexpansion. The men of 476 not only had no idea that they were entering\r\nupon a new era, but least of all did they dream that the Roman Empire\r\nhad come to an end, or was ever likely to. Its cities might be pillaged,\r\nits provinces overrun, but the supreme imperial power itself was\r\nsomething without which the men of those days could not imagine the\r\nworld as existing. It must have its divinely ordained representative in\r\none place if not in another. If the throne in Italy was vacant, it\r\nwas no more than had happened before; there was still a throne at\r\nConstantinople, and to its occupant Zeno the Roman Senate sent a\r\nmessage, saying that one emperor was enough for both ends of the earth,\r\nand begging him to confer upon the gallant Odovakar the title of\r\npatrician, and entrust the affairs of Italy to his care. So when\r\nSicambrian Chlodwig set up his Merovingian kingdom in northern Gaul, he\r\nwas glad to array himself in the robe of a Roman consul, and obtain from\r\nthe eastern emperor a formal ratification of his rule.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\u0027s note: page missing in original.] still survives in\r\npolitical methods and habits of thought that will yet be long in dying\r\nout. With great political systems, as with typical forms of organic\r\nlife, the processes of development and of extinction are exceedingly\r\nslow, and it is seldom that the stages can be sharply marked by dates.\r\nThe processes which have gradually shifted the seat of empire until the\r\nprominent part played nineteen centuries ago by Rome and Alexandria,\r\non opposite sides of the Mediterranean, has been at length assumed by\r\nLondon and New York, on opposite sides of the Atlantic, form a most\r\ninteresting subject of study. But to understand them, one must do much\r\nmore than merely catalogue the facts of political history; one must\r\nacquire a knowledge of the drifts and tendencies of human thought and\r\nfeeling and action from the earliest ages to the times in which we\r\nlive. In covering so wide a field we cannot of course expect to obtain\r\nanything like complete results. In order to make a statement simple\r\nenough to be generally intelligible, it is necessary to pass over many\r\ncircumstances and many considerations that might in one way and another\r\nqualify what we have to say. Nevertheless it is quite possible for us to\r\ndiscern, in their bold general outlines, some historic truths of supreme\r\nimportance. In contemplating the salient features of the change which\r\nhas now for a long time been making the world more English and less\r\nRoman, we shall find not only intellectual pleasure and profit but\r\npractical guidance. For in order to understand this slow but mighty\r\nchange, we must look a little into that process of nation-making which\r\nhas been going on since prehistoric ages and is going on here among us\r\nto-day, and from the recorded experience of men in times long past\r\nwe may gather lessons of infinite value for ourselves and for our\r\nchildren\u0027s children. As in all the achievements of mankind it is only\r\nafter much weary experiment and many a heart-sickening failure that\r\nsuccess is attained, so has it been especially with nation-making. Skill\r\nin the political art is the fruit of ages of intellectual and moral\r\ndiscipline; and just as picture-writing had to come before printing and\r\ncanoes before steamboats, so the cruder political methods had to be\r\ntried and found wanting, amid the tears and groans of unnumbered\r\ngenerations, before methods less crude could be put into operation. In\r\nthe historic survey upon which we are now to enter, we shall see that\r\nthe Roman Empire represented a crude method of nation-making which began\r\nwith a masterful career of triumph over earlier and cruder methods, but\r\nhas now for several centuries been giving way before a more potent and\r\nsatisfactory method. And just as the merest glance at the history of\r\nEurope shows us Germanic peoples wresting the supremacy from Rome, so in\r\nthis deeper study we shall discover a grand and far-reaching Teutonic\r\nIdea of political life overthrowing and supplanting the Roman Idea. Our\r\nattention will be drawn toward England as the battle-ground and the\r\nseventeenth century as the critical moment of the struggle; we shall see\r\nin Puritanism the tremendous militant force that determined the issue;\r\nand when our perspective has thus become properly adjusted, we shall\r\nbegin to realize for the first time how truly wonderful was the age that\r\nwitnessed the Beginnings of New England. We have long had before our\r\nminds the colossal figure of Roman Julius as \"the foremost man of all\r\nthis world,\" but as the seventeenth century recedes into the past\r\nthe figure of English Oliver begins to loom up as perhaps even more\r\ncolossal. In order to see these world-events in their true perspective,\r\nand to make perfectly clear the manner in which we are to estimate them,\r\nwe must go a long distance away from them. We must even go back, as\r\nnearly as may be, to the beginning of things. [Sidenote: Gradual\r\nshifting of primacy from the men who spoke Latin, and their descendants,\r\nto the men who speak English]\r\n\r\nIf we look back for a moment to the primitive stages of society, we may\r\npicture to ourselves the surface of the earth sparsely and scantily\r\ncovered with wandering tribes of savages, rude in morals and manners,\r\nnarrow and monotonous in experience, sustaining life very much as lower\r\nanimals sustain it, by gathering wild fruits or slaying wild game, and\r\nwaging chronic warfare alike with powerful beasts and with rival tribes\r\nof men. [Sidenote: Political history is the history of nation-making]\r\n\r\nIn the widest sense the subject of political history is the description\r\nof the processes by which, under favourable circumstances, innumerable\r\nsuch primitive tribes have become welded together into mighty nations,\r\nwith elevated standards of morals and manners, with wide and varied\r\nexperience, sustaining life and ministering to human happiness by\r\nelaborate arts and sciences, and putting a curb upon warfare by limiting\r\nits scope, diminishing its cruelty, and interrupting it by intervals of\r\npeace. The story, as laid before us in the records of three thousand\r\nyears, is fascinating and absorbing in its human interest for those who\r\ncontent themselves with the study of its countless personal incidents,\r\nand neglect its profound philosophical lessons. But for those who study\r\nit in the scientific spirit, the human interest of its details becomes\r\nstill more intensely fascinating and absorbing. Battles and coronations,\r\npoems and inventions, migrations and martyrdoms, acquire new meanings\r\nand awaken new emotions as we begin to discern their bearings upon the\r\nsolemn work of ages that is slowly winning for humanity a richer and\r\nmore perfect life. By such meditation upon men\u0027s thoughts and deeds is\r\nthe understanding purified, till we become better able to comprehend our\r\nrelations to the world and the duty that lies upon each of us to shape\r\nhis conduct rightly.\r\n\r\nIn the welding together of primitive shifting tribes into stable and\r\npowerful nations, we can seem to discern three different methods that\r\nhave been followed at different times and places, with widely different\r\nresults. In all cases the fusion has been effected by war, but it has\r\ngone on in three broadly contrasted ways. The first of these methods,\r\nwhich has been followed from time immemorial in the Oriental world, may\r\nbe roughly described as _conquest without incorporation._ A tribe grows\r\nto national dimensions by conquering and annexing its neighbours,\r\nwithout admitting them to a share in its political life. Probably there\r\nis always at first some incorporation, or even perhaps some crude germ\r\nof federative alliance; but this goes very little way,--only far enough\r\nto fuse together a few closely related tribes, agreeing in speech and\r\nhabits, into a single great tribe that can overwhelm its neighbours. In\r\nearly society this sort of incorporation cannot go far without being\r\nstopped by some impassable barrier of language or religion. After\r\nreaching that point, the conquering tribe simply annexes its neighbours\r\nand makes them its slaves. It becomes a superior caste, ruling over\r\nvanquished peoples, whom it oppresses with frightful cruelty, while\r\nliving on the fruits of their toil in what has been aptly termed\r\nOriental luxury. Such has been the origin of many eastern despotisms, in\r\nthe valleys of the Nile and Euphrates, and elsewhere. Such a political\r\nstructure admits of a very considerable development of material\r\ncivilization, in which gorgeous palaces and artistic temples may be\r\nbuilt, and perhaps even literature and scholarship rewarded, with money\r\nwrung from millions of toiling wretches. There is that sort of brutal\r\nstrength in it, that it may endure for many long ages, until it comes\r\ninto collision with some higher civilization. Then it is likely to end\r\nin sudden collapse, because the fighting quality of the people has\r\nbeen destroyed. Populations that have lived for centuries in fear of\r\nimpalement or crucifixion, and have known no other destination for\r\nthe products of their labour than the clutches of the omnipresent\r\ntax-gatherer, are not likely to furnish good soldiers. A handful of\r\nfreemen will scatter them like sheep, as the Greeks did twenty-three\r\ncenturies ago at Kynaxa, as the English did the other day at Tel\r\nel-Kebir. On the other hand, where the manliness of the vanquished\r\npeople is not crushed, the sway of the conquerors who cannot enter into\r\npolitical union with them is likely to be cast off, as in the case of\r\nthe Moors in Spain. There was a civilization in many respects admirable.\r\nIt was eminent for industry, science, art, and poetry; its annals are\r\nfull of romantic interest; it was in some respects superior to the\r\nChristian system which supplanted it; in many ways it contributed\r\nlargely to the progress of the human race; and it was free from some\r\nof the worst vices of Oriental civilizations. Yet because of the\r\nfundamental defect that between the Christian Spaniard and his\r\nMussulman conqueror there could be no political fusion, this brilliant\r\ncivilization was doomed. During eight centuries of more or less\r\nextensive rule in the Spanish peninsula, the Moor was from first to last\r\nan alien, just as after four centuries the Turk is still an alien in\r\nthe Balkan peninsula. The natural result was a struggle that lasted\r\nage after age till it ended in the utter extermination of one of the\r\nparties, and left behind it a legacy of hatred and persecution that has\r\nmade the history of modern Spain a dismal record of shame and disaster.\r\n[Sidenote: The Oriental method of nation-making]\r\n\r\nIn this first method of nation-making, then, which we may call the\r\nOriental method, one now sees but little to commend. It was better than\r\nsavagery, and for a long time no more efficient method was possible,\r\nbut the leading peoples of the world have long since outgrown it; and\r\nalthough the resulting form of political government is the oldest we\r\nknow and is not yet extinct, it nevertheless has not the elements\r\nof permanence. Sooner or later it will disappear, as savagery is\r\ndisappearing, as the rudest types of inchoate human society have\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe second method by which nations have been made may be called\r\nthe Roman method; and we may briefly describe it as _conquest with\r\nincorporation, but without representation_. The secret of Rome\u0027s\r\nwonderful strength lay in the fact that she incorporated the vanquished\r\npeoples into her own body politic. In the early time there was a fusion\r\nof tribes going on in Latium, which, if it had gone no further, would\r\nhave been similar to the early fusion of Ionic tribes in Attika or of\r\nIranian tribes in Media. But whereas everywhere else this political\r\nfusion soon stopped, in the Roman world it went on. One after another\r\nItalian tribes and Italian towns were not merely overcome but admitted\r\nto a share in the political rights and privileges of the victors. By the\r\ntime this had gone on until the whole Italian peninsula was consolidated\r\nunder the headship of Rome, the result was a power incomparably greater\r\nthan any other that the world had yet seen. Never before had so many\r\npeople been brought under one government without making slaves of most\r\nof them. Liberty had existed before, whether in barbaric tribes or\r\nin Greek cities. Union had existed before, in Assyrian or Persian\r\ndespotisms. Now liberty and union were for the first time joined\r\ntogether, with consequences enduring and stupendous. The whole\r\nMediterranean world was brought under one government; ancient barriers\r\nof religion, speech, and custom were overthrown in every direction; and\r\ninnumerable barbarian tribes, from the Alps to the wilds of northern\r\nBritain, from the Bay of Biscay to the Carpathian mountains, were more\r\nor less completely transformed into Roman citizens, protected by Roman\r\nlaw, and sharing in the material and spiritual benefits of Roman\r\ncivilization. Gradually the whole vast structure became permeated by\r\nHellenic and Jewish thought, and thus were laid the lasting foundations\r\nof modern society, of a common Christendom, furnished with a common\r\nstock of ideas concerning man\u0027s relation to God and the world, and\r\nacknowledging a common standard of right and wrong. This was a\r\nprodigious work, which raised human life to a much higher plane than\r\nthat which it had formerly occupied, and endless gratitude is due to the\r\nthousands of steadfast men who in one way or another devoted their lives\r\nto its accomplishment. [Sidenote: The Roman method of nation-making]\r\n\r\nThis Roman method of nation-making had nevertheless its fatal\r\nshortcomings, and it was only very slowly, moreover, that it wrought\r\nout its own best results. It was but gradually that the rights and\r\nprivileges of Roman citizenship were extended over the whole Roman\r\nworld, and in the mean time there were numerous instances where\r\nconquered provinces seemed destined to no better fate than had awaited\r\nthe victims of Egyptian or Assyrian conquest. The rapacity and cruelty\r\nof Caius Verres could hardly have been outdone by the worst of Persian\r\nsatraps; but there was a difference. A moral sense and political sense\r\nhad been awakened which could see both the wickedness and the folly of\r\nsuch conduct. The voice of a Cicero sounded with trumpet tones against\r\nthe oppressor, who was brought to trial and exiled for deeds which under\r\nthe Oriental system, from the days of Artaxerxes to those of the Grand\r\nTurk, would scarcely have called forth a reproving word. It was by slow\r\ndegrees that the Roman came to understand the virtues of his own method,\r\nand learned to apply it consistently until the people of all parts of\r\nthe empire were, in theory at least, equal before the law. In theory, I\r\nsay, for in point of fact there was enough of viciousness in the Roman\r\nsystem to prevent it from achieving permanent success. Historians have\r\nbeen fond of showing how the vitality of the whole system was impaired\r\nby wholesale slave-labour, by the false political economy which taxes\r\nall for the benefit of a few, by the debauching view of civil office\r\nwhich regards it as private perquisite and not as public trust,\r\nand--worst of all, perhaps--by the communistic practice of feeding an\r\nidle proletariat out of the imperial treasury. The names of these deadly\r\nsocial evils are not unfamiliar to American ears. Even of the last we\r\nhave heard ominous whispers in the shape of bills to promote mendicancy\r\nunder the specious guise of fostering education or rewarding military\r\nservices. And is it not a striking illustration of the slowness with\r\nwhich mankind learns the plainest rudiments of wisdom and of justice,\r\nthat only in the full light of the nineteenth century, and at the cost\r\nof a terrible war, should the most intelligent people on earth have got\r\nrid of a system of labour devised in the crudest ages of antiquity and\r\nfraught with misery to the employed, degradation to the employers, and\r\nloss to everybody? [Sidenote: Its slow development]\r\n\r\nThese evils, we see, in one shape or another, have existed almost\r\neverywhere; and the vice of the Roman system did not consist in the fact\r\nthat under it they were fully developed, but in the fact that it had no\r\nadequate means of overcoming them. Unless helped by something supplied\r\nfrom outside the Roman world, civilization must have succumbed to these\r\nevils, the progress of mankind must have been stopped. What was needed\r\nwas the introduction of a fierce spirit of personal liberty and local\r\nself-government. The essential vice of the Roman system was that it had\r\nbeen unable to avoid weakening the spirit of personal independence and\r\ncrushing out local self-government among the peoples to whom it had been\r\napplied. It owed its wonderful success to joining Liberty with Union,\r\nbut as it went on it found itself compelled gradually to sacrifice\r\nLiberty to Union, strengthening the hands of the central government and\r\nenlarging its functions more and more, until by and by the political\r\nlife of the several parts had so far died away that, under the pressure\r\nof attack from without, the Union fell to pieces and the whole political\r\nsystem had to be slowly and painfully reconstructed.\r\n\r\nNow if we ask why the Roman government found itself thus obliged to\r\nsacrifice personal liberty and local independence to the paramount\r\nnecessity of holding the empire together, the answer will point us to\r\nthe essential and fundamental vice of the Roman method of nation-making.\r\nIt lacked the principle of representation. The old Roman world knew\r\nnothing of representative assemblies. [Sidenote: It knew nothing of\r\nrepresentation]\r\n\r\nIts senates were assemblies of notables, constituting in the main an\r\naristocracy of men who had held high office; its popular assemblies were\r\nprimary assemblies,--town-meetings. There was no notion of such a thing\r\nas political power delegated by the people to representatives who were\r\nto wield it away from home and out of sight of their constituents. The\r\nRoman\u0027s only notion of delegated power was that of authority delegated\r\nby the government to its generals and prefects who discharged at a\r\ndistance its military and civil functions. When, therefore, the Roman\r\npopular government, originally adapted to a single city, had come\r\nto extend itself over a large part of the world, it lacked the one\r\ninstitution by means of which government could be carried on over\r\nso vast an area without degenerating into despotism. [Sidenote: And\r\ntherefore ended in despotism]\r\n\r\nEven could the device of representation have occurred to the mind of\r\nsome statesman trained in Roman methods, it would probably have made no\r\ndifference. Nobody would have known how to use it. You cannot invent\r\nan institution as you would invent a plough. Such a notion as that of\r\nrepresentative government must needs start from small beginnings and\r\ngrow in men\u0027s minds until it should become part and parcel of their\r\nmental habits. For the want of it the home government at Rome became\r\nmore and more unmanageable until it fell into the hands of the army,\r\nwhile at the same time the administration of the empire became more and\r\nmore centralized; the people of its various provinces, even while their\r\nsocial condition was in some respects improved, had less and less\r\nvoice in the management of their local affairs, and thus the spirit of\r\npersonal independence was gradually weakened. This centralization was\r\ngreatly intensified by the perpetual danger of invasion on the northern\r\nand eastern frontiers, all the way from the Rhine to the Euphrates.\r\nDo what it would, the government must become more and more a military\r\ndespotism, must revert toward the Oriental type. The period extending\r\nfrom the third century before Christ to the third century after was a\r\nperiod of extraordinary intellectual expansion and moral awakening; but\r\nwhen we observe the governmental changes introduced under the emperor\r\nDiocletian at the very end of this period, we realize how serious had\r\nbeen the political retrogression, how grave the danger that the stream\r\nof human life might come to stagnate in Europe, as it had long since\r\nstagnated in Asia.\r\n\r\nTwo mighty agents, cooperating in their opposite ways to prevent any\r\nsuch disaster, were already entering upon the scene. The first was the\r\ncolonization of the empire by Germanic tribes already far advanced\r\nbeyond savagery, already somewhat tinctured with Roman civilization, yet\r\nat the same time endowed with an intense spirit of personal and local\r\nindependence. With this wholesome spirit they were about to refresh and\r\nrevivify the empire, but at the risk of undoing its work of political\r\norganization and reducing it to barbarism. The second was the\r\nestablishment of the Roman church, an institution capable of holding\r\nEuropean society together in spite of a political disintegration that\r\nwas widespread and long-continued. While wave after wave of Germanic\r\ncolonization poured over romanized Europe, breaking down old\r\nboundary-lines and working sudden and astonishing changes on the map,\r\nsetting up in every quarter baronies, dukedoms, and kingdoms fermenting\r\nwith vigorous political life; while for twenty generations this salutary\r\nbut wild and dangerous work was going on, there was never a moment when\r\nthe imperial sway of Rome was quite set aside and forgotten, there was\r\nnever a time when union of some sort was not maintained through the\r\ndominion which the church had established over the European mind. When\r\nwe duly consider this great fact in its relations to what went before\r\nand what came after, it is hard to find words fit to express the debt of\r\ngratitude which modern civilization owes to the Roman Catholic church.\r\nWhen we think of all the work, big with promise of the future, that went\r\non in those centuries which modern writers in their ignorance used once\r\nto set apart and stigmatize as the \"Dark Ages\"; when we consider how the\r\nseeds of what is noblest in modern life were then painfully sown upon\r\nthe soil which imperial Rome had prepared; when we think of the various\r\nwork of a Gregory, a Benedict, a Boniface, an Alfred, a Charlemagne; we\r\nfeel that there is a sense in which the most brilliant achievements\r\nof pagan antiquity are dwarfed in comparison with these. Until quite\r\nlately, indeed, the student of history has had his attention too\r\nnarrowly confined to the ages that have been preeminent for literature\r\nand art--the so-called classical ages--and thus his sense of historical\r\nperspective has been impaired. When Mr. Freeman uses Gregory of Tours as\r\na text-book, he shows that he realizes how an epoch may be none the less\r\nportentous though it has not had a Tacitus to describe it, and certainly\r\nno part of history is more full of human interest than the troubled\r\nperiod in which the powerful streams of Teutonic life pouring into Roman\r\nEurope were curbed in their destructiveness and guided to noble ends by\r\nthe Catholic church. Out of the interaction between these two mighty\r\nagents has come the political system of the modern world. The moment\r\nwhen this interaction might have seemed on the point of reaching a\r\ncomplete and harmonious result was the glorious thirteenth century, the\r\nculminating moment of the Holy Roman Empire. Then, as in the times of\r\nCaesar or Trajan, there might have seemed to be a union among civilized\r\nmen, in which the separate life of individuals and localities was not\r\nsubmerged. In that golden age alike of feudal system, of empire, and of\r\nchurch, there were to be seen the greatest monarchs, in fullest sympathy\r\nwith their peoples, that Christendom has known,--an Edward I., a St.\r\nLouis, a Frederick II. Then when in the pontificates of Innocent III.\r\nand his successors the Roman church reached its apogee, the religious\r\nyearnings of men sought expression in the sublimest architecture the\r\nworld has seen. Then Aquinas summed up in his profound speculations the\r\nsubstance of Catholic theology, and while the morning twilight of modern\r\nscience might be discerned in the treatises of Roger Bacon, while\r\nwandering minstrelsy revealed the treasures of modern speech, soon to\r\nbe wrought under the hands of Dante and Chaucer into forms of exquisite\r\nbeauty, the sacred fervour of the apostolic ages found itself renewed in\r\nthe tender and mystic piety of St. Francis of Assisi. It was a wonderful\r\ntime, but after all less memorable as the culmination of mediaeval\r\nempire and mediaeval church than as the dawning of the new era in which\r\nwe live to-day, and in which the development of human society proceeds\r\nin accordance with more potent methods than those devised by the genius\r\nof pagan or Christian Rome. [Sidenote: The German invaders and the Roman\r\nchurch] [Sidenote: The wonderful thirteenth century]\r\n\r\nFor the origin of these more potent methods we must look back to the\r\nearly ages of the Teutonic people; for their development and application\r\non a grand scale we must look chiefly to the history of that most\r\nTeutonic of peoples in its institutions, though perhaps not more than\r\nhalf-Teutonic in blood, the English, with their descendants in the New\r\nWorld. The third method of nation-making may be called the Teutonic or\r\npreeminently the English method. It differs from the Oriental and Roman\r\nmethods which we have been considering in a feature of most profound\r\nsignificance; it contains the principle of representation. For this\r\nreason, though like all nation-making it was in its early stages\r\nattended with war and conquest, it nevertheless does not necessarily\r\nrequire war and conquest in order to be put into operation. Of the other\r\ntwo methods war was an essential part. In the typical Oriental nation,\r\nsuch as Assyria or Persia, we see a conquering tribe holding down a\r\nnumber of vanquished peoples, and treating them like slaves: here the\r\nnation is very imperfectly made, and its government is subject to sudden\r\nand violent changes. In the Roman empire we see a conquering people hold\r\nsway over a number of vanquished peoples, but instead of treating them\r\nlike slaves, it gradually makes them its equals before the law; here\r\nthe resulting political body is much more nearly a nation, and its\r\ngovernment is much more stable. A Lydian of the fifth century before\r\nChrist felt no sense of allegiance to the Persian master who simply\r\nrobbed and abused him; but the Gaul of the fifth century after Christ\r\nwas proud of the name of Roman and ready to fight for the empire of\r\nwhich he was a citizen. We have seen, nevertheless, that for want of\r\nrepresentation the Roman method failed when applied to an immense\r\nterritory, and the government tended to become more and more despotic,\r\nto revert toward the Oriental type. Now of the English or Teutonic\r\nmethod, I say, war is not an essential part; for where representative\r\ngovernment is once established, it is possible for a great nation to be\r\nformed by the peaceful coalescence of neighbouring states, or by their\r\nunion into a federal body. An instance of the former was the coalescence\r\nof England and Scotland effected early in the eighteenth century\r\nafter ages of mutual hostility; for instances of the latter we have\r\nSwitzerland and the United States. Now federalism, though its rise\r\nand establishment may be incidentally accompanied by warfare, is\r\nnevertheless in spirit pacific. Conquest in the Oriental sense is quite\r\nincompatible with it; conquest in the Roman sense is hardly less so. At\r\nthe close of our Civil War there were now and then zealous people to\r\nbe found who thought that the southern states ought to be treated as\r\nconquered territory, governed by prefects sent from Washington, and held\r\ndown by military force for a generation or so. Let us hope that there\r\nare few to-day who can fail to see that such a course would have been\r\nfraught with almost as much danger as the secession movement itself.\r\nAt least it would have been a hasty confession, quite uncalled for\r\nand quite untrue, that American federalism had thus far proved itself\r\nincompetent,--that we had indeed preserved our national unity, but only\r\nat the frightful cost of sinking to a lower plane of national life.\r\n[Sidenote: The English method of nation-making] [Sidenote: Pacific\r\ntendencies of federalism]\r\n\r\nBut federalism, with its pacific implications, was not an invention of\r\nthe Teutonic mind. The idea was familiar to the city communities of\r\nancient Greece, which, along with their intense love of self-government,\r\nfelt the need of combined action for warding off external attack. In\r\ntheir Achaian and Aitolian leagues the Greeks made brilliant attempts\r\ntoward founding a nation upon some higher principle than that of mere\r\nconquest, and the history of these attempts is exceedingly\r\ninteresting and instructive. They failed for lack of the principle\r\nof representation, which was practically unknown to the world until\r\nintroduced by the Teutonic colonizers of the Roman empire. Until the\r\nidea of power delegated by the people had become familiar to men\u0027s minds\r\nin its practical bearings, it was impossible to create a great nation\r\nwithout crushing out the political life in some of its parts. Some\r\ncentre of power was sure to absorb all the political life, and grow at\r\nthe expense of the outlying parts, until the result was a centralized\r\ndespotism. Hence it came to be one of the commonplace assumptions of\r\npolitical writers that republics must be small, that free government\r\nis practicable only in a confined area, and that the only strong and\r\ndurable government, capable of maintaining order throughout a vast\r\nterritory, is some form of absolute monarchy. [Sidenote: Fallacy of the\r\nnotion that republics must be small]\r\n\r\nIt was quite natural that people should formerly have held this opinion,\r\nand it is indeed not yet quite obsolete, but its fallaciousness will\r\nbecome more and more apparent as American history is better understood.\r\nOur experience has now so far widened that we can see that despotism\r\nis not the strongest but wellnigh the weakest form of government; that\r\ncentralized administrations, like that of the Roman empire, have fallen\r\nto pieces, not because of too much but because of too little freedom;\r\nand that the only perdurable government must be that which succeeds in\r\nachieving national unity on a grand scale, without weakening the sense\r\nof personal and local independence. For in the body politic this spirit\r\nof freedom is as the red corpuscles in the blood; it carries the life\r\nwith it. It makes the difference between a society of self-respecting\r\nmen and women and a society of puppets.\r\n\r\nYour nation may have art, poetry, and science, all the refinements of\r\ncivilized life, all the comforts and safeguards that human ingenuity can\r\ndevise; but if it lose this spirit of personal and local independence,\r\nit is doomed and deserves its doom. As President Cleveland has well\r\nsaid, it is not the business of a government to support its people, but\r\nof the people to support their government; and once to lose sight\r\nof this vital truth is as dangerous as to trifle with some stealthy\r\nnarcotic poison. Of the two opposite perils which have perpetually\r\nthreatened the welfare of political society--anarchy on the one hand,\r\nloss of self-government on the other--Jefferson was right in maintaining\r\nthat the latter is really the more to be dreaded because its beginnings\r\nare so terribly insidious. Many will understand what is meant by a\r\nthreat of secession, where few take heed of the baneful principle\r\ninvolved in a Texas Seed-bill.\r\n\r\nThat the American people are still fairly alive to the importance of\r\nthese considerations, is due to the weary ages of struggle in which our\r\nforefathers have manfully contended for the right of self-government.\r\nFrom the days of Arminius and Civilis in the wilds of lower Germany to\r\nthe days of Franklin and Jefferson in Independence Hall, we have been\r\nengaged in this struggle, not without some toughening of our political\r\nfibre, not without some refining of our moral sense. Not among our\r\nEnglish forefathers only, but among all the peoples of mediaeval and\r\nmodern Europe has the struggle gone on, with various and instructive\r\nresults. In all parts of romanized Europe invaded and colonized by\r\nTeutonic tribes, self-government attempted to spring up. What may have\r\nbeen the origin of the idea of representation we do not know; like most\r\norigins, it seems lost in the prehistoric darkness. Wherever we find\r\nTeutonic tribes settling down over a wide area, we find them holding\r\ntheir primary assemblies, usually their annual March-meetings, like\r\nthose in which Mr. Hosea Biglow and others like him have figured.\r\nEverywhere, too, we find some attempt at representative assemblies,\r\nbased on the principle of the three estates, clergy, nobles, and\r\ncommons. But nowhere save in England does the representative principle\r\nbecome firmly established, at first in county-meetings, afterward in a\r\nnational parliament limiting the powers of the national monarch as the\r\nprimary tribal assembly had limited the powers of the tribal chief. It\r\nis for this reason that we must call the method of nation-making by\r\nmeans of a representative assembly the English method. While the idea of\r\nrepresentation was perhaps the common property of the Teutonic tribes,\r\nit was only in England that it was successfully put into practice and\r\nbecame the dominant political idea. We may therefore agree with Dr.\r\nStubbs that in its political development England is the most Teutonic of\r\nall European countries,--the country which in becoming a great nation\r\nhas most fully preserved the local independence so characteristic of the\r\nancient Germans. The reasons for this are complicated, and to try to\r\nassign them all would needlessly encumber our exposition. But there is\r\none that is apparent and extremely instructive. There is sometimes a\r\ngreat advantage in being able to plant political institutions in a\r\nvirgin soil, where they run no risk of being modified or perhaps\r\nmetamorphosed through contact with rival institutions. In America the\r\nTeutonic idea has been worked out even more completely than in Britain;\r\nand so far as institutions are concerned, our English forefathers\r\nsettled here as in an empty country. They were not obliged to modify\r\ntheir political ideas so as to bring them into harmony with those of the\r\nIndians; the disparity in civilization was so great that the Indians\r\nwere simply thrust aside, along with the wolves and buffaloes.\r\n[Sidenote: Teutonic March-meetings and representative assemblies]\r\n\r\nThis illustration will help us to understand the peculiar features of\r\nthe Teutonic settlement of Britain. Whether the English invaders really\r\nslew all the romanized Kelts who dwelt in the island, except those who\r\nfound refuge in the mountains of Cumberland, Wales, and Cornwall, or\r\nfled across the channel to Brittany, we need not seek to decide. It\r\nis enough to point out one respect in which the Teutonic conquest was\r\nimmeasurably more complete in Britain than in any other part of the\r\nempire. Everywhere else the tribes who settled upon Roman soil--the\r\nGoths, Vandals, Suevi, and Burgundians--were christianized, and so to\r\nsome extent romanized, before they came to take possession. Even the\r\nmore distant Franks had been converted to Christianity before they\r\nhad completed their conquest of Gaul. Everywhere except in Britain,\r\ntherefore, the conquerors had already imbibed Roman ideas, and the\r\nauthority of Rome was in a certain sense acknowledged. There was no\r\nbreak in the continuity of political events. In Britain, on the other\r\nhand, there was a complete break, so that while on the continent the\r\nfifth and sixth centuries are seen in the full midday light of history,\r\nin Britain they have lapsed into the twilight of half-legendary\r\ntradition. The Saxon and English tribes, coming from the remote wilds\r\nof northern Germany, whither Roman missionaries had not yet penetrated,\r\nstill worshipped Thor and Wodan; and their conquest of Britain was\r\neffected with such deadly thoroughness that Christianity was destroyed\r\nthere, or lingered only in sequestered nooks. A land once christianized\r\nthus actually fell back into paganism, so that the work of converting it\r\nto Christianity had to be done over again. From the landing of heathen\r\nHengest on the isle of Thanet to the landing of Augustine and his monks\r\non the same spot, one hundred and forty-eight years elapsed, during\r\nwhich English institutions found time to take deep root in British\r\nsoil with scarcely more interference, as to essential points, than in\r\nAmerican soil twelve centuries afterward. [Sidenote: Peculiarity of the\r\nTeutonic conquest of Britain]\r\n\r\nThe century and a half between 449 and 597 is therefore one of the most\r\nimportant epochs in the history of the people that speak the English\r\nlanguage. Before settling in Britain our forefathers had been tribes in\r\nthe upper stages of barbarism; now they began the process of coalescence\r\ninto a nation in which the principle of self-government should be\r\nretained and developed. The township and its town-meeting we find there,\r\nas later in New England. The county-meeting we also find, while the\r\ncounty is a little state in itself and not a mere administrative\r\ndistrict. And in this county-meeting we may observe a singular feature,\r\nsomething never seen before in the world, something destined to work\r\nout vaster political results than Caesar ever dreamed of. This\r\ncounty-meeting is not a primary assembly; all the freemen from all the\r\ntownships cannot leave their homes and their daily business to attend\r\nit. Nor is it merely an assembly of notables, attended by the most\r\nimportant men of the neighbourhood. It is a representative assembly,\r\nattended by select men from each township. We may see in it the germ of\r\nthe British parliament and of the American congress, as indeed of all\r\nmodern legislative bodies, for it is a most suggestive commentary upon\r\nwhat we are saying that in all other countries which have legislatures,\r\nthey have been copied, within quite recent times, from English or\r\nAmerican models. We can seldom if ever fix a date for the beginning\r\nof anything, and we can by no means fix a date for the beginning of\r\nrepresentative assemblies in England. We can only say that where\r\nwe first find traces of county organization, we find traces of\r\nrepresentation. Clearly, if the English conquerors of Britain had left\r\nthe framework of Roman institutions standing there, as it remained\r\nstanding in Gaul, there would have been great danger of this principle\r\nof representation not surviving. It would most likely have been crushed\r\nin its callow infancy. The conquerors would insensibly have fallen into\r\nthe Roman way of doing things, as they did in Gaul. [Sidenote: Survival\r\nand development of Teutonic representative assembly in England]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the start, then, we find the English nationality growing up under\r\nvery different conditions from those which obtained in other parts\r\nof Europe. So far as institutions are concerned, Teutonism was less\r\nmodified in England than in the German fatherland itself, For the\r\ngradual conquest and Christianization of Germany which began with\r\nCharles the Great, and went on until in the thirteenth century the\r\nfrontier had advanced eastward to the Vistula, entailed to a certain\r\nextent the romanization of Germany. For a thousand years after Charles\r\nthe Great, the political head of Germany was also the political head\r\nof the Holy Roman Empire, and the civil and criminal code by which the\r\ndaily life of the modern German citizen is regulated is based upon the\r\njurisprudence of Rome. Nothing, perhaps, could illustrate more forcibly\r\nthan this sheer contrast the peculiarly Teutonic character of English\r\ncivilization. Between the eighth and the eleventh centuries, when the\r\nformation of English nationality was approaching completion, it received\r\na fresh and powerful infusion of Teutonism in the swarms of heathen\r\nNorthmen or Danes who occupied the eastern coasts, struggled long for\r\nthe supremacy, and gradually becoming christianized, for a moment\r\nsucceeded in seizing the crown. Of the invasion of partially romanized\r\nNorthmen from Normandy which followed soon after, and which has so\r\nprofoundly affected English society and English speech, we need notice\r\nhere but two conspicuous features. First, it increased the power of the\r\ncrown and the clergy, brought all England more than ever under one law,\r\nand strengthened the feeling of nationality. It thus made England a\r\nformidable military power, while at the same time it brought her into\r\ncloser relations with continental Europe than she had held since the\r\nfourth century. Secondly, by superposing a new feudal nobility as the\r\nupper stratum of society, it transformed the Old-English thanehood into\r\nthe finest middle-class of rural gentry and yeomanry that has ever\r\nexisted in any country; a point of especial interest to Americans, since\r\nit was in this stratum of society that the two most powerful streams of\r\nEnglish migration to America--the Virginia stream and the New\r\nEngland stream--alike had their source. [Sidenote: Primitive Teutonic\r\ninstitutions less modified in England than in Germany]\r\n\r\nBy the thirteenth century the increasing power and pretensions of the\r\ncrown, as the unification of English nationality went on, brought about\r\na result unlike anything known on the continent of Europe; it brought\r\nabout a resistless coalition between the great nobles, the rural gentry\r\nand yeomanry, and the burghers of the towns, for the purpose of curbing\r\nroyalty, arresting the progress of centralization, and setting up\r\nrepresentative government on a truly national scale. This grand result\r\nwas partly due to peculiar circumstances which had their origin in\r\nthe Norman conquest; but it was largely due to the political habits\r\ngenerated by long experience of local representative assemblies,--habits\r\nwhich made it comparatively easy for different classes of society to\r\nfind their voice and use it for the attainment of ends in common. On the\r\ncontinent of Europe the encroaching sovereign had to contend with\r\nhere and there an arrogant vassal, here and there a high-spirited and\r\nrebellious town; in England, in this first great crisis of popular\r\ngovernment, he found himself confronted by a united people. The fruits\r\nof the grand combination were _first_, the wresting of Magna Charta from\r\nKing John in 1215, and _secondly_, the meeting of the first House of\r\nCommons in 1265. Four years of civil war were required to secure these\r\nnoble results. The Barons\u0027 War, of the years 1263 to 1267, was an\r\nevent of the same order of importance as the Great Rebellion of the\r\nseventeenth century and the American Revolution; and among the\r\nfounders of that political freedom which is enjoyed to-day by all\r\nEnglish-speaking people, the name of Simon de Montfort, Earl of\r\nLeicester, deserves a place in our grateful remembrance beside the names\r\nof Cromwell and Washington. Simon\u0027s great victory at Lewes in 1264 must\r\nrank with Naseby and Yorktown. The work begun by his House of Commons\r\nwas the same work that has continued to go on without essential\r\ninterruption down to the days of Cleveland and Gladstone. The\r\nfundamental principle of political freedom is \"no taxation without\r\nrepresentation\"; you must not take a farthing of my money without\r\nconsulting my wishes as to the use that shall be made of it. Only\r\nwhen this principle of justice was first practically recognized, did\r\ngovernment begin to divorce itself from the primitive bestial barbaric\r\nsystem of tyranny and plunder, and to ally itself with the forces that\r\nin the fulness of time are to bring peace on earth and good will to\r\nmen. Of all dates in history, therefore, there is none more fit to be\r\ncommemorated than 1265; for in that year there was first asserted and\r\napplied at Westminster, on a national scale, that fundamental principle\r\nof \"no taxation without representation,\" that innermost kernel of the\r\nEnglish Idea, which the Stamp Act Congress defended at New York exactly\r\nfive hundred years afterward. When we think of these dates, by the way,\r\nwe realize the import of the saying that in the sight of the Lord a\r\nthousand years are but as a day, and we feel that the work of the Lord\r\ncannot be done by the listless or the slothful. So much time and so much\r\nstrife by sea and land has it taken to secure beyond peradventure the\r\nboon to mankind for which Earl Simon gave up his noble life on the field\r\nof Evesham! Nor without unremitting watchfulness can we be sure that the\r\nday of peril is yet past. From kings, indeed, we have no more to fear;\r\nthey have come to be as spooks and bogies of the nursery. But the\r\ngravest dangers are those which present themselves in new forms, against\r\nwhich people\u0027s minds have not yet been fortified with traditional\r\nsentiments and phrases. The inherited predatory tendency of men to seize\r\nupon the fruits of other people\u0027s labour is still very strong, and while\r\nwe have nothing more to fear from kings, we may yet have trouble enough\r\nfrom commercial monopolies and favoured industries, marching to the\r\npolls their hordes of bribed retainers. Well indeed has it been said\r\nthat eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. God never meant that in\r\nthis fair but treacherous world in which He has placed us we should earn\r\nour salvation without steadfast labour. [Eternal vigilance is the price\r\nof liberty]\r\n\r\nTo return to Earl Simon, we see that it was just in that wonderful\r\nthirteenth century, when the Roman idea of government might seem to\r\nhave been attaining its richest and most fruitful development, that the\r\nricher and more fruitful English idea first became incarnate in the\r\npolitical constitution of a great and rapidly growing nation. It was not\r\nlong before the struggle between the Roman Idea and the English Idea,\r\nclothed in various forms, became the dominating issue in European\r\nhistory. We have now to observe the rise of modern nationalities, as new\r\ncentres of political life, out of the various provinces of the Roman\r\nworld. In the course of this development the Teutonic representative\r\nassembly is at first everywhere discernible, in some form or other,\r\nas in the Spanish Cortes or the States-General of France, but on the\r\ncontinent it generally dies out. Only in such nooks as Switzerland and\r\nthe Netherlands does it survive. In the great nations it succumbs before\r\nthe encroachments of the crown. The comparatively novel Teutonic idea of\r\npower delegated by the people to their representatives had not become\r\ndeeply enough rooted in the political soil of the continent; and\r\naccordingly we find it more and more disused and at length almost\r\nforgotten, while the old and deeply rooted Roman idea of power delegated\r\nby the governing body to its lieutenants and prefects usurps its place.\r\nLet us observe some of the most striking features of this growth of\r\nmodern nationalities. [Sidenote: Conflict between Roman Idea and English\r\nIdea begins to become clearly visible in the thirteenth century]\r\n\r\nThe reader of medieval history cannot fail to be impressed with the\r\nsuddenness with which the culmination of the Holy Roman Empire, in\r\nthe thirteenth century, was followed by a swift decline. The imperial\r\nposition of the Hapsburgs was far less splendid than that of the\r\nHohenstauffen; it rapidly became more German and less European, until\r\nby and by people began to forget what the empire originally meant.\r\nThe change which came over the papacy was even more remarkable. The\r\ngrandchildren of the men who had witnessed the spectacle of a king of\r\nFrance and a king of England humbled at the feet of Innocent III., the\r\nchildren of the men who had found the gigantic powers of a Frederick II.\r\nunequal to the task of curbing the papacy, now beheld the successors of\r\nSt. Peter carried away to Avignon, there to be kept for seventy years\r\nunder the supervision of the kings of France. Henceforth the glory of\r\nthe papacy in its political aspect was to be but the faint shadow of\r\nthat with which it had shone before. This sudden change in its position\r\nshowed that the medieval dream of a world-empire was passing away,\r\nand that new powers were coming uppermost in the shape of modern\r\nnationalities with their national sovereigns. So long as these\r\nnationalities were in the weakness of their early formation, it was\r\npossible for pope and emperor to assert, and sometimes to come near\r\nmaintaining, universal supremacy. But the time was now at hand when\r\nkings could assert their independence of the pope, while the emperor was\r\nfast sinking to be merely one among kings.\r\n\r\nAs modern kingdoms thus grew at the expense of empire and papacy above,\r\nso they also grew at the expense of feudal dukedoms, earldoms, and\r\nbaronies below. The fourteenth and fifteenth centuries were as fatal\r\nto feudalism as to world-empire and world-church. A series of wars\r\noccurring at this time were especially remarkable for the wholesale\r\nslaughter of the feudal nobility, whether on the field or under the\r\nheadsman\u0027s axe. This was a conspicuous feature of the feuds of the\r\nTrastamare in Spain, of the English invasions of France, followed by the\r\nquarrel between Burgundians and Armagnacs, and of the great war of the\r\nRoses in England. So thorough-going was the butchery in England, for\r\nexample, that only twenty-nine lay peers could be found to sit in the\r\nfirst parliament of Henry VII in 1485. The old nobility was almost\r\nannihilated, both in person and in property; for along with the\r\nslaughter there went wholesale confiscation, and this added greatly to\r\nthe disposable wealth of the crown. The case was essentially similar in\r\nFrance and Spain. In all three countries the beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncentury saw the power of the crown increased and increasing. Its vast\r\naccessions of wealth made it more independent of legislative assemblies,\r\nand at the same time enabled it to make the baronage more subservient in\r\ncharacter by filling up the vacant places with new creations of its own.\r\nThrough the turbulent history of the next two centuries, we see the\r\nroyal power aiming at unchecked supremacy and in the principal instances\r\nattaining it except in England. Absolute despotism was reached first in\r\nSpain, under Philip II.; in France it was reached a century later, under\r\nLouis XIV.; and at about the same time in the hereditary estates of\r\nAustria; while over all the Italian and German soil of the disorganized\r\nempire, except among the glaciers of Switzerland and the dykes of the\r\nNetherlands, the play of political forces had set up a host of petty\r\ntyrannies which aped the morals and manners of the great autocrats at\r\nParis and Madrid and Vienna. [Sidenote: Increasing power of the crown]\r\n\r\nAs we look back over this growth of modern monarchy, we cannot but\r\nbe struck with the immense practical difficulty of creating a strong\r\nnationality without sacrificing self-government. Powerful, indeed, is\r\nthe tendency toward over-centralization, toward stagnation, toward\r\npolitical death. Powerful is the tendency to revert to the Roman, if not\r\nto the Oriental method. As often as we reflect upon the general state of\r\nthings at the end of the seventeenth century--the dreadful ignorance and\r\nmisery which prevailed among most of the people of continental Europe,\r\nand apparently without hope of remedy--so often must we be impressed\r\nanew with the stupendous significance of the part played by\r\nself-governing England in overcoming dangers which have threatened the\r\nvery existence of modern civilization. It is not too much to say that\r\nin the seventeenth century the entire political future of mankind was\r\nstaked upon the questions that were at issue in England. To keep the\r\nsacred flame of liberty alive required such a rare and wonderful\r\nconcurrence of conditions that, had our forefathers then succumbed in\r\nthe strife, it is hard to imagine how or where the failure could have\r\nbeen repaired. Some of these conditions we have already considered; let\r\nus now observe one of the most important of all. Let us note the part\r\nplayed by that most tremendous of social forces, religious sentiment,\r\nin its relation to the political circumstances which we have passed\r\nin review. If we ask why it was that among modern nations absolute\r\ndespotism was soonest and most completely established in Spain, we find\r\nit instructive to observe that the circumstances under which the\r\nSpanish monarchy grew up, during centuries of deadly struggle with the\r\nMussulman, were such as to enlist the religious sentiment on the side of\r\ndespotic methods in church and state. It becomes interesting, then, to\r\nobserve by contrast how it was that in England the dominant religious\r\nsentiment came to be enlisted on the side of political freedom.\r\n[Illustration: Had it not been for the Puritans, political liberty would\r\nprobably have disappeared from the world]\r\n\r\nIn such an inquiry we have nothing to do with the truth or falsity of\r\nany system of doctrines, whether Catholic or Protestant. The legitimate\r\npurposes of the historian do not require him to intrude upon the\r\nprovince of the theologian. Our business is to trace the sequence of\r\npolitical cause and effect. Nor shall we get much help from crude\r\nsweeping statements which set forth Catholicism as invariably the enemy\r\nand Protestantism as invariably the ally of human liberty. The Catholic\r\nhas a right to be offended at statements which would involve a\r\nHildebrand or a St. Francis in the same historical judgment with a\r\nSigismund or a Torquemada. The character of ecclesiastical as of all\r\nother institutions has varied with the character of the men who have\r\nworked them and the varying needs of the times and places in which they\r\nhave been worked; and our intense feeling of the gratitude we owe to\r\nEnglish Puritanism need in nowise diminish the enthusiasm with which we\r\npraise the glorious work of the mediaeval church. It is the duty of\r\nthe historian to learn how to limit and qualify his words of blame or\r\napproval; for so curiously is human nature compounded of strength and\r\nweakness that the best of human institutions are likely to be infected\r\nwith some germs of vice or folly. [Sidenote: Beginnings of Protestantism\r\nin the thirteenth century]\r\n\r\nOf no human institution is this more true than of the great medieval\r\nchurch of Gregory and Innocent when viewed in the light of its claims\r\nto unlimited temporal and spiritual sovereignty. In striking down the\r\nheadship of the emperors, it would have reduced Europe to a sort of\r\nOriental caliphate, had it not been checked by the rising spirit of\r\nnationality already referred to. But there was another and even mightier\r\nagency coming in to curb its undue pretensions to absolute sovereignty.\r\nThat same thirteenth century which witnessed the culmination of its\r\npower witnessed also the first bold and determined manifestation of the\r\nProtestant temper of revolt against spiritual despotism. It was long\r\nbefore this that the earliest Protestant heresy had percolated into\r\nEurope, having its source, like so many other heresies, in that eastern\r\nworld where the stimulating thought of the Greeks busied itself with the\r\nancient theologies of Asia. From Armenia in the eighth century came the\r\nManichaean sect of Paulicians into Thrace, and for twenty generations\r\nplayed a considerable part in the history of the Eastern Empire. In the\r\nBulgarian tongue they were known as Bogomilians, or men constant in\r\nprayer. In Greek they were called Cathari, or \"Puritans.\" They accepted\r\nthe New Testament, but set little store by the Old; they laughed at\r\ntransubstantiation, denied any mystical efficiency to baptism, frowned\r\nupon image-worship as no better than idolatry, despised the intercession\r\nof saints, and condemned the worship of the Virgin Mary. As for the\r\nsymbol of the cross, they scornfully asked, \"If any man slew the son of\r\na king with a bit of wood, how could this piece of wood be dear to the\r\nking?\" Their ecclesiastical government was in the main presbyterian, and\r\nin politics they showed a decided leaning toward democracy. They wore\r\nlong faces, looked askance at frivolous amusements, and were terribly in\r\nearnest. Of the more obscure pages of mediaeval history, none are fuller\r\nof interest than those in which we decipher the westward progress of\r\nthese sturdy heretics through the Balkan peninsula into Italy, and\r\nthence into southern France, where toward the end of the twelfth century\r\nwe find their ideas coming to full blossom in the great Albigensian\r\nheresy. It was no light affair to assault the church in the days of\r\nInnocent III. The terrible crusade against the Albigenses, beginning in\r\n1207, was the joint work of the most powerful of popes and one of the\r\nmost powerful of French kings. On the part of Innocent it was the\r\nstamping out of a revolt that threatened the very existence of\r\nthe Catholic hierarchy; on the part of Philip Augustus it was the\r\nsuppression of those too independent vassals the Counts of Toulouse, and\r\nthe decisive subjection of the southern provinces to the government at\r\nParis. Nowhere in European history do we read a more frightful story\r\nthan that which tells of the blazing fires which consumed thousand after\r\nthousand of the most intelligent and thrifty people in France. It was\r\nnow that the Holy Inquisition came into existence, and after forty years\r\nof slaughter these Albigensian Cathari or Puritans seemed exterminated.\r\nThe practice of burning heretics, first enacted by statute in Aragon in\r\n1197, was adopted in most parts of Europe during the thirteenth century,\r\nbut in England not until the beginning of the fifteenth. The Inquisition\r\nwas never established in England. Edward II. attempted to introduce\r\nit in 1311 for the purpose of suppressing the Templars, but his utter\r\nfailure showed that the instinct of self-government was too strong in\r\nthe English people to tolerate the entrusting of so much power over\r\nmen\u0027s lives to agents of the papacy. Mediaeval England was ignorant and\r\nbigoted enough, but under a representative government which so strongly\r\npermeated society, it was impossible to set the machinery of repression\r\nto work with such deadly thoroughness as it worked under the guidance of\r\nRoman methods. When we read the history of persecution in England, the\r\nstory in itself is dreadful enough; but when we compare it with the\r\nhorrors enacted in other countries, we arrive at some startling results.\r\nDuring the two centuries of English persecution, from Henry IV. to James\r\nI., some 400 persons were burned at the stake, and three-fourths of\r\nthese cases occurred in 1555-57, the last three years of Mary Tudor.\r\nNow in a single province of Spain, in the single year 1482, about 2000\r\npersons were burned. The lowest estimates of the number slain for heresy\r\nin the Netherlands in the course of the sixteenth century place it at\r\n75,000. Very likely such figures are in many cases grossly exaggerated.\r\nBut after making due allowance for this, the contrast is sufficiently\r\nimpressive. In England the persecution of heretics was feeble and\r\nspasmodic, and only at one moment rose to anything like the appalling\r\nvigour which ordinarily characterized it in countries where the\r\nInquisition was firmly established. Now among the victims of religious\r\npersecution must necessarily be found an unusual proportion of men and\r\nwomen more independent than the average in their thinking, and more\r\nbold than the average in uttering their thoughts. The Inquisition was a\r\ndiabolical winnowing machine for removing from society the most flexible\r\nminds and the stoutest hearts; and among every people in which it was\r\nestablished for a length of time it wrought serious damage to the\r\nnational character. It ruined the fair promise of Spain, and inflicted\r\nincalculable detriment upon the fortunes of France. No nation could\r\nafford to deprive itself of such a valuable element in its political\r\nlife as was furnished in the thirteenth century by the intelligent and\r\nsturdy Cathari of southern Gaul. [Sidenote: The Cathari, or Puritans of\r\nthe Eastern Empire] [Sidenote: The Albigenses] [Sidenote: Effects of\r\npersecution; its feebleness in England]\r\n\r\nThe spirit of revolt against the hierarchy, though broken and repressed\r\nthus terribly by the measures of Innocent III., continued to live on\r\nobscurely in sequestered spots, in the mountains of Savoy, and Bosnia,\r\nand Bohemia, ready on occasion to spring into fresh and vigorous life.\r\nIn the following century Protestant ideas were rapidly germinating in\r\nEngland, alike in baron\u0027s castle, in yeoman\u0027s farmstead, in citizen\u0027s\r\nshop, in the cloistered walks of the monastery. Henry Knighton,\r\nwriting in the time of Richard II., declares, with the exaggeration of\r\nimpatience, that every second man you met was a Lollard, or \"babbler,\"\r\nfor such was the nickname given to these free-thinkers, of whom the most\r\neminent was John Wyclif, professor at Oxford, and rector of Lutterworth,\r\ngreatest scholar of the age. [Sidenote: Wyclif and the Lollards]\r\n\r\nThe career of this man is a striking commentary upon the difference\r\nbetween England and continental Europe in the Middle Ages. Wyclif denied\r\ntransubstantiation, disapproved of auricular confession, opposed the\r\npayment of Peter\u0027s pence, taught that kings should not be subject to\r\nprelates, translated the Bible into English and circulated it among the\r\npeople, and even denounced the reigning pope as Antichrist; yet he was\r\nnot put to death, because there was as yet no act of parliament for the\r\nburning of heretics, and in England things must be done according to the\r\nlaws which the people had made. [1] Pope Gregory XI. issued five bulls\r\nagainst him, addressed to the king, the archbishop of Canterbury, and\r\nthe university of Oxford; but their dictatorial tone offended the\r\nnational feeling, and no heed was paid to them. Seventeen years after\r\nWyclif\u0027s death, the statute for burning heretics was passed, and the\r\npersecution of Lollards began. It was feeble and ineffectual, however.\r\nLollardism was never trampled out in England as Catharism was trampled\r\nout in France. Tracts of Wyclif and passages from his translation of\r\nthe Bible were copied by hand and secretly passed about to be read on\r\nSundays in the manor-house, or by the cottage fireside after the day\u0027s\r\ntoil was over. The work went on quietly, but not the less effectively,\r\nuntil when the papal authority was defied by Henry VIII., it soon became\r\napparent that England was half-Protestant already. It then appeared\r\nalso that in this Reformation there were two forces cooperating,--the\r\nsentiment of national independence which would not brook dictation from\r\nRome, and the Puritan sentiment of revolt against the hierarchy in\r\ngeneral. The first sentiment had found expression again and again in\r\nrefusals to pay tribute to Rome, in defiance of papal bulls, and in the\r\nfamous statutes of _praemunire_, which made it a criminal offence to\r\nacknowledge any authority in England higher than the crown. The revolt\r\nof Henry VIII. was simply the carrying out of these acts of Edward I.\r\nand Edward III. to their logical conclusion. It completed the detachment\r\nof England from the Holy Roman Empire, and made her free of all the\r\nworld. Its intent was political rather than religious. Henry, who wrote\r\nagainst Martin Luther, was far from wishing to make England a Protestant\r\ncountry. Elizabeth, who differed from her father in not caring a straw\r\nfor theology, was by temperament and policy conservative. Yet England\r\ncould not cease to be Papist without ceasing in some measure to be\r\nCatholic; nor could she in that day carry on war against Spain without\r\nbecoming a leading champion of Protestantism. The changes in creed and\r\nritual wrought by the government during this period were cautious and\r\nskilful; and the resulting church of England, with its long line of\r\nlearned and liberal divines, has played a noble part in history.\r\n[Sidenote: Political character of Henry VIII\u0027s revolt against Rome]\r\n\r\nBut along with this moderate Protestantism espoused by the English\r\ngovernment, as consequent upon the assertion of English national\r\nindependence, there grew up the fierce uncompromising democratic\r\nProtestantism of which the persecuted Lollards had sown the seeds. This\r\nwas not the work of government. [Sidenote: The yeoman, Hugh Latimer]\r\n\r\nBy the side of Henry VIII. stands the sublime figure of Hugh Latimer,\r\nmost dauntless of preachers, the one man before whose stern rebuke the\r\nheadstrong and masterful Tudor monarch quailed. It was Latimer\r\nthat renewed the work of Wyclif. and in his life as well as in his\r\nmartyrdom,--to use his own words of good cheer uttered while the fagots\r\nwere kindling around him,--lighted \"such a candle in England as by God\u0027s\r\ngrace shall never be put out.\" This indomitable man belonged to that\r\nmiddle-class of self-governing, self-respecting yeomanry that has been\r\nthe glory of free England and free America. He was one of the sturdy\r\nrace that overthrew French chivalry at Crecy and twice drove the\r\nsoldiery of a tyrant down the slope of Bunker Hill. In boyhood he worked\r\non his father\u0027s farm and helped his mother to milk the thirty kine; he\r\npractised archery on the village green, studied in the village school,\r\nwent to Cambridge, and became the foremost preacher of Christendom. Now\r\nthe most thorough and radical work of the English Reformation was done\r\nby this class of men of which Latimer was the type. It was work that was\r\nnational in its scope, arousing to fervent heat the strong religious\r\nand moral sentiment of the people, and hence it soon quite outran the\r\ncautious and conservative policy of the government, and tended to\r\nintroduce changes extremely distasteful to those who wished to keep\r\nEngland as nearly Catholic as was consistent with independence of the\r\npope. Hence before the end of Elizabeth\u0027s reign, we find the crown set\r\nalmost as strongly against Puritanism as against Romanism. Hence, too,\r\nwhen under Elizabeth\u0027s successors the great decisive struggle between\r\ndespotism and liberty was inaugurated, we find all the tremendous force\r\nof this newly awakened religious enthusiasm cooperating with the English\r\nlove of self-government and carrying it under Cromwell to victory. From\r\nthis fortunate alliance of religious and political forces has come all\r\nthe noble and fruitful work of the last two centuries in which men of\r\nEnglish speech have been labouring for the political regeneration of\r\nmankind. But for this alliance of forces, it is quite possible that the\r\nfateful seventeenth century might have seen despotism triumphant in\r\nEngland as on the continent of Europe, and the progress of civilization\r\nindefinitely arrested. [Sidenote: The moment of Cromwell\u0027s triumph was\r\nthe most critical moment in history]\r\n\r\nIn illustration of this possibility, observe what happened in France\r\nat the very time when the victorious English tendencies were shaping\r\nthemselves in the reign of Elizabeth. In France there was a strong\r\nProtestant movement, but it had no such independent middle-class to\r\nsupport it as that which existed in England; nor had it been able to\r\nprofit by such indispensable preliminary work as that which Wyclif had\r\ndone; the horrible slaughter of the Albigenses had deprived France of\r\nthe very people who might have played a part in some way analogous to\r\nthat of the Lollards. Consequently the Protestant movement in France\r\nfailed to become a national movement. Against the wretched Henry III who\r\nwould have temporized with it, and the gallant Henry IV who honestly\r\nespoused it, the oppressed peasantry and townsmen made common cause by\r\nenlisting under the banner of the ultra-Catholic Guises. The mass of\r\nthe people saw nothing in Protestantism but an idea favoured by the\r\naristocracy and which they could not comprehend. Hence the great king\r\nwho would have been glad to make France a Protestant country could only\r\nobtain his crown by renouncing his religion, while seeking to protect\r\nit by his memorable Edict of Nantes. But what a generous despot could\r\ngrant, a bigoted despot might revoke; and before another century had\r\nelapsed, the good work done by Henry IV. was undone by Louis XIV., the\r\nEdict of Nantes was set aside, the process of casting out the most\r\nvaluable political element in the community was carried to completion,\r\nand seven percent of the population of France was driven away and added\r\nto the Protestant populations of northern Germany and England and\r\nAmerica. The gain to these countries and the damage to France was far\r\ngreater than the mere figures would imply; for in determining the\r\ncharacter of a community a hundred selected men and women are more\r\npotent than a thousand men and women taken at random. Thus while the\r\nReformation in France reinforced to some extent the noble army of\r\nfreemen, its triumphs were not to be the triumphs of Frenchmen, but of\r\nthe race which has known how to enlist under its banner the forces that\r\nfight for free thought, free speech, and self-government, and all that\r\nthese phrases imply. [Sidenote: Contrast with France; fate of the\r\nHuguenots]\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts we may see how tremendous was the question at\r\nstake with the Puritans of the seventeenth century. Everywhere else the\r\nRoman idea seemed to have conquered or to be conquering, while they\r\nseemed to be left as the forlorn hope of the human race. But from the\r\nvery day when Oliver Cromwell reached forth his mighty arm to stop the\r\npersecutions in Savoy, the victorious English idea began to change the\r\nface of things. The next century saw William Pitt allied with Frederick\r\nof Prussia to save the work of the Reformation in central Europe and set\r\nin motion the train of events that were at last to make the people of\r\nthe Teutonic fatherland a nation. At that same moment the keenest\r\nminds in France were awaking to the fact that in their immediate\r\nneighbourhood, separated from them only by a few miles of salt water,\r\nwas a country where people were equal in the eye of the law. It was the\r\nideas of Locke and Milton, of Vane and Sidney, that, when transplanted\r\ninto French soil, produced that violent but salutary Revolution which\r\nhas given fresh life to the European world. And contemporaneously with\r\nall this, the American nation came upon the scene, equipped as no\r\nother nation had ever been, for the task of combining sovereignty with\r\nliberty, indestructible union of the whole with indestructible life in\r\nthe parts. The English idea has thus come to be more than national,\r\nit has become imperial. It has come to rule, and it has come to stay.\r\n[Sidenote: Victory of the English Idea]\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to answer the question when the Roman Empire\r\ncame to an end, in so far as it can be answered at all. It did not come\r\nto its end at the hands of an Odovakar in the year 476, or of a Mahomet\r\nII in 1453, or of a Napoleon in 1806. It has been coming to its end as\r\nthe Roman idea of nation-making has been at length decisively overcome\r\nby the English idea. For such a fact it is impossible to assign a date,\r\nbecause it is not an event but a stage in the endless procession\r\nof events. But we can point to landmarks on the way. Of movements\r\nsignificant and prophetic there have been many. The whole course of the\r\nProtestant reformation, from the thirteenth century to the nineteenth,\r\nis coincident with the transfer of the world\u0027s political centre of\r\ngravity from the Tiber and the Rhine to the Thames and the Mississippi.\r\nThe whole career of the men who speak English has within this period\r\nbeen the most potent agency in this transfer. In these gigantic\r\nprocesses of evolution we cannot mark beginnings or endings by years,\r\nhardly even by centuries. But among the significant events which\r\nprophesied the final triumph of the English over the Roman idea, perhaps\r\nthe most significant--the one which marks most incisively the dawning\r\nof a new era--was the migration of English Puritans across the Atlantic\r\nOcean, to repeat in a new environment and on a far grander scale the\r\nwork which their forefathers had wrought in Britain. The voyage of the\r\nMayflower was not in itself the greatest event in this migration; but\r\nit serves to mark the era, and it is only when we study it in the mood\r\nawakened by the general considerations here set forth that we can\r\nproperly estimate the historic importance of the great Puritan Exodus.\r\n[Sidenote: Significance of the Puritan Exodus]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE PURITAN EXODUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter I endeavoured to set forth and illustrate some\r\nof the chief causes which have shifted the world\u0027s political centre of\r\ngravity from the Mediterranean and the Rhine to the Atlantic and the\r\nMississippi; from the men who spoke Latin to the men who speak English.\r\nIn the course of the exposition we began to catch glimpses of the\r\nwonderful significance of the fact that--among the people who had\r\nfirst suggested the true solution of the difficult problem of making a\r\npowerful nation without sacrificing local self-government--when the\r\nsupreme day of trial came, the dominant religious sentiment was arrayed\r\non the side of political freedom and against political despotism. If we\r\nconsider merely the territorial area which it covered, or the numbers\r\nof men slain in its battles, the war of the English parliament against\r\nCharles I. seems a trivial affair when contrasted with the gigantic\r\nbut comparatively insignificant work of barbarians like Jinghis or\r\nTamerlane. But if we consider the moral and political issues involved,\r\nand the influence of the struggle upon the future welfare of mankind,\r\nwe soon come to see that there never was a conflict of more world-wide\r\nimportance than that from which Oliver Cromwell came out victorious. It\r\nshattered the monarchical power in England at a time when monarchical\r\npower was bearing down all opposition in the other great countries of\r\nEurope. It decided that government by the people and for the people\r\nshould not then perish from the earth. It placed free England in a\r\nposition of such moral advantage that within another century the\r\nEnglish Idea of political life was able to react most powerfully upon\r\ncontinental Europe. It was the study of English institutions by such men\r\nas Montesquieu and Turgot, Voltaire and Rousseau, that gave shape and\r\ndirection to the French Revolution. That violent but wholesome clearing\r\nof the air, that tremendous political and moral awakening, which ushered\r\nin the nineteenth century in Europe, had its sources in the spirit\r\nwhich animated the preaching of Latimer, the song of Milton, the solemn\r\nimagery of Bunyan, the political treatises of Locke and Sidney, the\r\npolitical measures of Hampden and Pym. The noblest type of modern\r\nEuropean statesmanship, as represented by Mazzini and Stein, is the\r\nspiritual offspring of seventeenth-century Puritanism. To speak of\r\nNaseby and Marston Moor as merely English victories would be as\r\nabsurd as to restrict the significance of Gettysburg to the state of\r\nPennsylvania. If ever there were men who laid down their lives in the\r\ncause of all mankind, it was those grim old Ironsides whose watchwords\r\nwere texts from Holy Writ, whose battle-cries were hymns of praise.\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of Puritanism upon modern Europe]\r\n\r\nIt was to this unwonted alliance of intense religious enthusiasm with\r\nthe instinct of self-government and the spirit of personal independence\r\nthat the preservation of English freedom was due. When James I. ascended\r\nthe English throne, the forces which prepared the Puritan revolt had\r\nbeen slowly and quietly gathering strength among the people for at least\r\ntwo centuries. The work which Wyclif had begun in the fourteenth century\r\nhad continued to go on in spite of occasional spasmodic attempts to\r\ndestroy it with the aid of the statute passed in 1401 for the burning\r\nof heretics. The Lollards can hardly be said at any time to have\r\nconstituted a sect, marked off from the established church by the\r\npossession of a system of doctrines held in common. The name by which\r\nthey were known was a nickname which might cover almost any amount\r\nof diversity in opinion, like the modern epithets \"free-thinker\" and\r\n\"agnostic.\" The feature which characterized the Lollards in common was a\r\nbold spirit of inquiry which led them, in spite of persecution, to read\r\nWyclif\u0027s English Bible and call in question such dogmas and rites of the\r\nchurch as did not seem to find warrant in the sacred text. Clad in long\r\nrobes of coarse red wool, barefoot, with pilgrim\u0027s staff in hand, the\r\nLollard preachers fared to and fro among the quaint Gothic towns and\r\nshaded hamlets, setting forth the word of God wherever they could find\r\nlisteners, now in the parish church or under the vaulted roof of the\r\ncathedral, now in the churchyard or market-place, or on some green\r\nhillside. During the fifteenth century persecution did much to check\r\nthis open preaching, but passages from Wyclif\u0027s tracts and texts from\r\nthe Bible were copied by hand and passed about among tradesmen and\r\nartisans, yeomen and plough-boys, to be pondered over and talked about\r\nand learned by heart. It was a new revelation to the English people,\r\nthis discovery of the Bible. Christ and his disciples seemed to come\r\nvery near when the beautiful story of the gospels was first read in\r\nthe familiar speech of every-day life. Heretofore they might well have\r\nseemed remote and unreal, just as the school-boy hardly realizes that\r\nthe Cato and Cassius over whom he puzzles in his Latin lessons were once\r\nliving men like his father and neighbours, and not mere nominatives\r\ngoverning a verb, or ablatives of means or instrument. Now it became\r\npossible for the layman to contrast the pure teachings of Christ with\r\nthe doctrines and demeanour of the priests and monks to whom the\r\nspiritual guidance of Englishmen had been entrusted. Strong and\r\nself-respecting men and women, accustomed to manage their own affairs,\r\ncould not but be profoundly affected by the contrast. [Sidenote: Work of\r\nthe Lollards]\r\n\r\nWhile they were thus led more and more to appeal to the Bible as the\r\ndivine standard of right living and right thinking, at the same time\r\nthey found in the sacred volume the treasures of a most original and\r\nnoble literature unrolled before them; stirring history and romantic\r\nlegend, cosmical theories and priestly injunctions, profound metaphysics\r\nand pithy proverbs, psalms of unrivalled grandeur and pastorals of\r\nexquisite loveliness, parables fraught with solemn meaning, the mournful\r\nwisdom of the preacher, the exultant faith of the apostle, the matchless\r\neloquence of Job and Isaiah, the apocalyptic ecstasy of St. John. At a\r\ntime when there was as yet no English literature for the common people,\r\nthis untold wealth of Hebrew literature was implanted in the English\r\nmind as in a virgin soil. Great consequences have flowed from the fact\r\nthat the first truly popular literature in England--the first which\r\nstirred the hearts of all classes of people, and filled their minds with\r\nideal pictures and their every-day speech with apt and telling phrases--\r\nwas the literature comprised within the Bible. The superiority of the\r\ncommon English version of the Bible, made in the reign of James I., over\r\nall other versions, is a fact generally admitted by competent critics.\r\nThe sonorous Latin of the Vulgate is very grand, but in sublimity of\r\nfervour as in the unconscious simplicity of strength it is surpassed\r\nby the English version, which is scarcely if at all inferior to the\r\noriginal, while it remains to-day, and will long remain, the noblest\r\nmonument of English speech. The reason for this is obvious. The common\r\nEnglish version of the Bible was made by men who were not aiming at\r\nliterary effect, but simply gave natural expression to the feelings\r\nwhich for several generations had clustered around the sacred text. They\r\nspoke with the voice of a people, which is more than the voice of the\r\nmost highly gifted man. They spoke with the voice of a people to whom\r\nthe Bible had come to mean all that it meant to the men who wrote it. To\r\nthe Englishmen who listened to Latimer, to the Scotchmen who listened\r\nto Knox, the Bible more than filled the place which in modern times\r\nis filled by poem and essay, by novel and newspaper and scientific\r\ntreatise. To its pages they went for daily instruction and comfort,\r\nwith its strange Semitic names they baptized their children, upon its\r\nprecepts, too often misunderstood and misapplied, they sought to build\r\nup a rule of life that might raise them above the crude and unsatisfying\r\nworld into which they were born. [Sidenote: The English version of the\r\nBible]\r\n\r\nIt would be wrong to accredit all this awakening of spiritual life in\r\nEngland to Wyclif and the Lollards, for it was only after the Bible, in\r\nthe translations of Tyndall and Coverdale, had been made free to the\r\nwhole English people in the reign of Edward VI. that its significance\r\nbegan to be apparent; and it was only a century later, in the time of\r\nCromwell and Milton, that its full fruition was reached. It was with the\r\nLollards, however, that the spiritual awakening began and was continued\r\nuntil its effects, when they came, were marked by surprising maturity\r\nand suddenness. Because the Lollards were not a clearly defined sect, it\r\nwas hard to trace the manifold ramifications of their work. During the\r\nterrible Wars of the Roses, contemporary chroniclers had little or\r\nnothing to say about the labours of these humble men, which seemed\r\nof less importance than now, when we read them in the light of their\r\nworld-wide results. From this silence some modern historians have\r\ncarelessly inferred that the nascent Protestantism of the Lollards had\r\nbeen extinguished by persecution under the Lancastrian kings, and was in\r\nnowise continuous with modern English Protestantism. Nothing could be\r\nmore erroneous. The extent to which the Lollard leaven had permeated all\r\nclasses of English society was first clearly revealed when Henry VIII.\r\nmade his domestic affairs the occasion for a revolt against the Papacy.\r\nDespot and brute as he was in many ways, Henry had some characteristics\r\nwhich enabled him to get on well with his people. He not only\r\nrepresented the sentiment of national independence, but he had a truly\r\nEnglish reverence for the forms of law. In his worst acts he relied upon\r\nthe support of his Parliament, which he might in various ways cajole or\r\npack, but could not really enslave. In his quarrel with Rome he could\r\nhave achieved but little, had he not happened to strike a chord of\r\nfeeling to which the English people, trained by this slow and subtle\r\nwork of the Lollards, responded quickly and with a vehemence upon which\r\nhe had not reckoned. As if by magic, the fabric of Romanism was broken\r\nto pieces in England, monasteries were suppressed and their abbots\r\nhanged, the authority of the Pope was swept away, and there was no\r\npowerful party, like that of the Guises in France to make such sweeping\r\nmeasures the occasion for civil war. The whole secret of Henry\u0027s swift\r\nsuccess lay in the fact that the English people were already more than\r\nhalf Protestant in temper, and needed only an occasion for declaring\r\nthemselves. Hence, as soon as Catholic Henry died, his youthful son\r\nfound himself seated on the throne of a Protestant nation. The terrible\r\nbut feeble persecution which followed under Mary did much to strengthen\r\nthe extreme Protestant sentiment by allying it with the outraged feeling\r\nof national independence. The bloody work of the grand-daughter of\r\nFerdinand and Isabella, the doting wife of Philip II., was rightly felt\r\nto be Spanish work; and never, perhaps, did England feel such a sense of\r\nrelief as on the auspicious day which welcomed to the throne the great\r\nElizabeth, an Englishwoman in every fibre, and whose mother withal was\r\nthe daughter of a plain country gentleman. But the Marian persecution\r\nnot only increased the strength of the extreme Protestant sentiment, but\r\nindirectly it supplied it with that Calvinistic theology which was to\r\nmake it indomitable. Of the hundreds of ministers and laymen who fled\r\nfrom England in 1555 and the two following years, a great part found\r\ntheir way to Geneva, and thus came under the immediate personal\r\ninfluence of that man of iron who taught the very doctrines for which\r\ntheir souls were craving, and who was then at the zenith of his power.\r\n[Sidenote: Secret of Henry VIII.\u0027s swift success in his revolt against\r\nRome] [Sidenote: Effects of the persecution under Mary]\r\n\r\nAmong all the great benefactors of mankind the figure of Calvin is\r\nperhaps the least attractive. He was, so to speak, the constitutional\r\nlawyer of the Reformation, with vision as clear, with head as cool, with\r\nsoul as dry, as any old solicitor in rusty black that ever dwelt in\r\nchambers in Lincoln\u0027s Inn. His sternness was that of the judge who\r\ndooms a criminal to the gallows. His theology had much in it that is in\r\nstriking harmony with modern scientific philosophy, and much in it, too,\r\nthat the descendants of his Puritan converts have learned to loathe as\r\nsheer diabolism. It is hard for us to forgive the man who burned Michael\r\nServetus, even though it was the custom of the time to do such things\r\nand the tender-hearted Melanchthon found nothing to blame in it. It is\r\nnot easy to speak of Calvin with enthusiasm, as it comes natural to\r\nspeak of the genial, whole-souled, many-sided, mirth-and-song-loving\r\nLuther. Nevertheless it would be hard to overrate the debt which mankind\r\nowe to Calvin. The spiritual father of Coligny, of William the Silent,\r\nand of Cromwell must occupy a foremost rank among the champions of\r\nmodern democracy. Perhaps not one of the mediaeval popes was more\r\ndespotic in temper than Calvin; but it is not the less true that the\r\npromulgation of his theology was one of the longest steps that mankind\r\nhave taken toward personal freedom. Calvinism left the individual man\r\nalone in the presence of his God. His salvation could not be wrought by\r\npriestly ritual, but only by the grace of God abounding in his soul; and\r\nwretched creature that he felt himself to be, through the intense moral\r\nawakening of which this stern theology was in part the expression, his\r\nsoul was nevertheless of infinite value, and the possession of it was\r\nthe subject of an everlasting struggle between the powers of heaven and\r\nthe powers of hell. In presence of the awful responsibility of life, all\r\ndistinctions of rank and fortune vanished; prince and pauper were alike\r\nthe helpless creatures of Jehovah and suppliants for his grace. Calvin\r\ndid not originate these doctrines; in announcing them he was but setting\r\nforth, as he said, the Institutes of the Christian religion; but in\r\nemphasizing this aspect of Christianity, in engraving it upon men\u0027s\r\nminds with that keen-edged logic which he used with such unrivalled\r\nskill, Calvin made them feel, as it had perhaps never been felt before,\r\nthe dignity and importance of the individual human soul. It was a\r\nreligion fit to inspire men who were to be called upon to fight for\r\nfreedom, whether in the marshes of the Netherlands or on the moors of\r\nScotland. In a church, moreover, based upon such a theology there was\r\nno room for prelacy. Each single church tended to become an independent\r\ncongregation of worshippers, constituting one of the most effective\r\nschools that has ever existed for training men in local self-government.\r\n[Sidenote: Calvin\u0027s theology in its political bearings]\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, upon the news of Elizabeth\u0027s accession to the throne,\r\nthe Protestant refugees made their way back to England, they came as\r\nCalvinistic Puritans. Their stay upon the Continent had been short, but\r\nit had been just enough to put the finishing touch upon the work that\r\nhad been going on since the days of Wyclif. Upon such men and their\r\ntheories Elizabeth could not look with favour. With all her father\u0027s\r\ndespotic temper, Elizabeth possessed her mother\u0027s fine tact, and\r\nshe represented so grandly the feeling of the nation in its\r\nlife-and-death-struggle with Spain and the pope, that never perhaps in\r\nEnglish history has the crown wielded so much real power as during the\r\nfive-and-forty years of her wonderful reign.\r\n\r\nOne day Elizabeth asked a lady of the court how she contrived to retain\r\nher husband\u0027s affection. The lady replied that \"she had confidence\r\nin her husband\u0027s understanding and courage, well founded on her own\r\nsteadfastness not to offend or thwart, but to cherish and obey, whereby\r\nshe did persuade her husband of her own affection, and in so doing did\r\ncommand his.\" \"Go to, go to, mistress,\" cried the queen, \"You are\r\nwisely bent, I find. After such sort do I keep the good will of all\r\nmy husbands, my good people; for if they did not rest assured of some\r\nspecial love towards them, they would not readily yield me such good\r\nobedience.\" [2] Such a theory of government might work well in the hands\r\nof an Elizabeth, and in the circumstances in which England was then\r\nplaced; but it could hardly be worked by a successor. The seeds of\r\nrevolt were already sown. The disposition to curb the sovereign was\r\ngrowing and would surely assert itself as soon as it should have some\r\nperson less loved and respected than Elizabeth to deal with. The queen\r\nin some measure foresaw this, and in the dogged independence and\r\nuncompromising enthusiasm of the Puritans she recognized the rock on\r\nwhich the monarchy might dash itself into pieces. She therefore hated\r\nthe Puritans, and persecuted them zealously with one hand, while\r\ncircumstances forced her in spite of herself to aid and abet them with\r\nthe other. She could not maintain herself against Spain without helping\r\nthe Dutch and the Huguenots; but every soldier she sent across the\r\nchannel came back, if he came at all, with his head full of the\r\ndoctrines of Calvin; and these stalwart converts were reinforced by the\r\nrefugees from France and the Netherlands who came flocking into English\r\ntowns to set up their thrifty shops and hold prayer-meetings in their\r\nhumble chapels. To guard the kingdom against the intrigues of Philip and\r\nthe Guises and the Queen of Scots, it was necessary to choose the most\r\nzealous Protestants for the most responsible positions, and such men\r\nwere more than likely to be Calvinists and Puritans. Elizabeth\u0027s great\r\nministers, Burleigh, Walsingham, and Nicholas Bacon, were inclined\r\ntoward Puritanism; and so were the naval heroes who won the most\r\nfruitful victories of that century, by shattering the maritime power of\r\nSpain and thus opening the way for Englishmen to colonize North America.\r\nIf we would realize the dangers that would have beset the Mayflower and\r\nher successors but for the preparatory work of these immortal sailors,\r\nwe must remember the dreadful fate of Ribault and his Huguenot followers\r\nin Florida, twenty-three years before that most happy and glorious\r\nevent, the destruction of the Spanish Armada. But not even the devoted\r\nmen and women who held their prayer-meetings in the Mayflower\u0027s cabin\r\nwere more constant in prayer or more assiduous in reading the Bible than\r\nthe dauntless rovers, Drake and Hawkins, Gilbert and Cavendish. In the\r\nchurch itself, too, the Puritan spirit grew until in 1575-83 it seized\r\nupon Grindal, archbishop of Canterbury, who incurred the queen\u0027s\r\ndisfavour by refusing to meddle with the troublesome reformers or to\r\nsuppress their prophesyings. By the end of the century the majority\r\nof country gentlemen and of wealthy merchants in the towns had become\r\nPuritans, and the new views had made great headway in both universities,\r\nwhile at Cambridge they had become dominant. [Sidenote: Elizabeth\u0027s\r\npolicy, and its effects] [Sidenote: Puritan Sea-rovers]\r\n\r\nThis allusion to the universities may serve to introduce the very\r\ninteresting topic of the geographical distribution of Puritanism in\r\nEngland. No one can study the history of the two universities without\r\nbeing impressed with the greater conservatism of Oxford, and the greater\r\nhospitality of Cambridge toward new ideas. Possibly the explanation\r\nmay have some connection with the situation of Cambridge upon the East\r\nAnglian border. The eastern counties of England have often been remarked\r\nas rife in heresy and independency. For many generations the coast\r\nregion between the Thames and the Humber was a veritable _litus\r\nhaereticum._ Longland, bishop of Lincoln in 1520, reported Lollardism as\r\nespecially vigorous and obstinate in his diocese, where more than two\r\nhundred heretics were once brought before him in the course of a single\r\nvisitation. It was in Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, and Essex, and\r\namong the fens of Ely, Cambridge, and Huntingdon, that Puritanism was\r\nstrongest at the end of the sixteenth century. It was as member and\r\nleading spirit of the Eastern Counties Association that Oliver Cromwell\r\nbegan his military career; and in so far as there was anything sectional\r\nin the struggle between Charles I. and the Long Parliament, it was a\r\nstruggle which ended in the victory of east over west. East Anglia was\r\nfrom first to last the one region in which the supremacy of Parliament\r\nwas unquestionable and impregnable, even after the strength of its\r\npopulation had been diminished by sending some thousands of picked men\r\nand women to America. While every one of the forty counties of England\r\nwas represented in the great Puritan exodus, the East Anglian counties\r\ncontributed to it far more than all the rest. Perhaps it would not be\r\nfar out of the way to say that two-thirds of the American people who can\r\ntrace their ancestry to New England might follow it back to the East\r\nAnglian shires of the mother-country; one-sixth might follow it to those\r\nsouthwestern countries--Devonshire, Dorset, and Somerset--which so\r\nlong were foremost in maritime enterprise; one-sixth to other parts of\r\nEngland. I would not insist upon the exactness of such figures, in a\r\nmatter where only a rough approximation is possible; but I do not think\r\nthey overstate the East Anglian preponderance. It was not by accident\r\nthat the earliest counties of Massachusetts were called Norfolk,\r\nSuffolk, and Essex, or that Boston in Lincolnshire gave its name to the\r\nchief city of New England. The native of Connecticut or Massachusetts\r\nwho wanders about rural England to-day finds no part of it so homelike\r\nas the cosy villages and smiling fields and quaint market towns as he\r\nfares leisurely and in not too straight a line from Ipswich toward Hull.\r\nCountless little unobtrusive features remind him of home. The very names\r\non the sign-boards over the sleepy shops have an unwontedly familiar\r\nlook. In many instances the homestead which his forefathers left, when\r\nthey followed Winthrop or Hooker to America, is still to be found,\r\nwell-kept and comfortable; the ancient manor-house built of massive\r\nunhewn stone, yet in other respects much like the New England farmhouse,\r\nwith its long sloping roof and gable end toward the road, its staircase\r\nwith twisted balusters running across the shallow entry-way, its low\r\nceilings with their sturdy oaken beams, its spacious chimneys, and its\r\nnarrow casements from which one might have looked out upon the anxious\r\nmarch of Edward IV. from Ravenspur to the field of victory at Barnet\r\nin days when America was unknown. Hard by, in the little parish church\r\nwhich has stood for perhaps a thousand years, plain enough and bleak\r\nenough to suit the taste of the sternest Puritan, one may read upon\r\nthe cold pavement one\u0027s own name and the names of one\u0027s friends and\r\nneighbours in startling proximity, somewhat worn and effaced by the\r\ncountless feet that have trodden there. And yonder on the village green\r\none comes with bated breath upon the simple inscription which tells of\r\nsome humble hero who on that spot in the evil reign of Mary suffered\r\ndeath by fire. Pursuing thus our interesting journey, we may come at\r\nlast to the quiet villages of Austerfield and Scrooby, on opposite\r\nbanks of the river Idle, and just at the corner of the three shires of\r\nLincoln, York, and Nottingham. It was from this point that the Puritan\r\nexodus to America was begun. [Sidenote: Puritanism was strongest in the\r\neastern counties] [Sidenote: Preponderance of East Anglia in the Puritan\r\nexodus]\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, in the main stream of Puritanism, but in one of its\r\nobscure rivulets that this world-famous movement originated. During the\r\nreign of Elizabeth it was not the purpose of the Puritans to separate\r\nthemselves from the established church of which the sovereign was the\r\nhead, but to remain within it and reform it according to their own\r\nnotions. For a time they were partially successful in this work,\r\nespecially in simplifying the ritual and in giving a Calvinistic tinge\r\nto the doctrines. In doing this they showed no conscious tendency toward\r\nfreedom of thought, but rather a bigotry quite as intense as that which\r\nanimated the system against which they were fighting. The most advanced\r\nliberalism of Elizabeth\u0027s time was not to be found among the Puritans,\r\nbut in the magnificent treatise on \"Ecclesiastical Polity\" by the\r\nchurchman Richard Hooker. But the liberalism of this great writer, like\r\nthat of Erasmus a century earlier, was not militant enough to meet the\r\nsterner demands of the time. It could not then ally itself with the\r\ndemocratic spirit, as Puritanism did. It has been well said that while\r\nLuther was the prophet of the Reformation that has been, Erasmus was the\r\nprophet of the Reformation that is to come, and so it was to some extent\r\nwith the Puritans and Hooker. The Puritan fight against the hierarchy\r\nwas a political necessity of the time, something without which no real\r\nand thorough reformation could then be effected. In her antipathy to\r\nthis democratic movement, Elizabeth vexed and tormented the Puritans\r\nas far as she deemed it prudent; and in the conservative temper of the\r\npeople she found enough support to prevent their transforming the church\r\nas they would have liked to do. Among the Puritans themselves, indeed,\r\nthere was no definite agreement on this point. Some would have stopped\r\nshort with Presbyterianism, while others held that \"new presbyter was\r\nbut old priest writ large,\" and so pressed on to Independency. It was\r\nearly in Elizabeth\u0027s reign that the zeal of these extreme brethren,\r\ninflamed by persecution, gave rise to the sect of Separatists, who\r\nflatly denied the royal supremacy over ecclesiastical affairs, and\r\nasserted the right to set up churches of their own, with pastors\r\nand elders and rules of discipline, independent of queen or bishop.\r\n[Sidenote: Puritanism was not intentionally allied with liberalism]\r\n\r\nIn 1567 the first congregation of this sort, consisting of about a\r\nhundred persons assembled in a hall in Anchor Lane in London, was\r\nforcibly broken up and thirty-one of the number were sent to jail and\r\nkept there for nearly a year. By 1576 the Separatists had come to be\r\nrecognized as a sect, under the lead of Robert Brown, a man of high\r\nsocial position, related to the great Lord Burleigh. Brown fled to\r\nHolland, where he preached to a congregation of English exiles, and\r\nwrote books which were smuggled into England and privately circulated\r\nthere, much to the disgust, not only of the queen, but of all parties,\r\nPuritans as well as High Churchmen. The great majority of Puritans,\r\nwhose aim was not to leave the church, but to stay in it and control\r\nit, looked with dread and disapproval upon these extremists who seemed\r\nlikely to endanger their success by forcing them into deadly opposition\r\nto the crown. Just as in the years which ushered in our late Civil War,\r\nthe opponents of the Republicans sought to throw discredit upon them by\r\nconfusing them with the little sect of Abolitionists; and just as the\r\nRepublicans, in resenting the imputation, went so far as to frown upon\r\nthe Abolitionists, so that in December, 1860, men who had just voted for\r\nMr. Lincoln were ready to join in breaking up \"John Brown meetings\" in\r\nBoston; so it was with religious parties in the reign of Elizabeth. The\r\nopponents of the Puritans pointed to the Separatists, and cried, \"See\r\nwhither your anarchical doctrines are leading!\" and in their eagerness\r\nto clear themselves of this insinuation, the leading Puritans were as\r\nsevere upon the Separatists as anybody. It is worthy of note that in\r\nboth instances the imputation, so warmly resented, was true. Under the\r\npressure of actual hostilities the Republicans did become Abolitionists,\r\nand in like manner, when in England it came to downright warfare the\r\nPuritans became Separatists. But meanwhile it fared ill with the little\r\nsect which everybody hated and despised. Their meetings were broken up\r\nby mobs. In an old pamphlet describing a \"tumult in Fleet Street, raised\r\nby the disorderly preachment, pratings, and prattlings of a swarm of\r\nSeparatists,\" one reads such sentences as the following: \"At length they\r\ncatcht one of them alone, but they kickt him so vehemently as if they\r\nmeant to beat him into a jelly. It is ambiguous whether they have kil\u0027d\r\nhim or no, but for a certainty they did knock him about as if they meant\r\nto pull him to pieces. I confesse it had been no matter if they had\r\nbeaten the whole tribe in the like manner.\" For their leaders the\r\npenalty was more serious. The denial of the queen\u0027s ecclesiastical\r\nsupremacy could be treated as high treason, and two of Brown\u0027s friends,\r\nconvicted of circulating his books, were sent to the gallows. In spite\r\nof these dangers Brown returned to England in 1585. William the Silent\r\nhad lately been murdered, and heresy in Holland was not yet safe from\r\nthe long arm of the Spaniard. Brown trusted in Lord Burleigh\u0027s ability\r\nto protect him, but in 1588, finding himself in imminent danger, he\r\nsuddenly recanted and accepted a comfortable living under the bishops\r\nwho had just condemned him. His followers were already known as\r\nBrownists; henceforth their enemies took pains to call them so and twit\r\nthem with holding doctrines too weak for making martyrs. [Sidenote:\r\nRobert Brown and the Separatists]\r\n\r\nThe flimsiness of Brown\u0027s moral texture prevented him from becoming the\r\nleader in the Puritan exodus to New England. That honour was reserved\r\nfor William Brewster, son of a country gentleman who had for many\r\nyears been postmaster at Scrooby. The office was then one of high\r\nresponsibility and influence. After taking his degree at Cambridge,\r\nBrewster became private secretary to Sir William Davison, whom he\r\naccompanied on his mission to the Netherlands. When Davison\u0027s public\r\ncareer came to an end in 1587, Brewster returned to Scrooby, and soon\r\nafterward succeeded his father as postmaster, in which position he\r\nremained until 1607. During the interval Elizabeth died, and James\r\nStuart came from Scotland to take her place on the throne. [Sidenote:\r\nWilliam Brewster]\r\n\r\nThe feelings with which the late queen had regarded Puritanism were mild\r\ncompared with the sentiments entertained by her successor. For some\r\nyears he had been getting worsted in his struggle with the Presbyterians\r\nof the northern kingdom. His vindictive memory treasured up the day when\r\na mighty Puritan preacher had in public twitched him by the sleeve and\r\ncalled him \"God\u0027s silly vassal.\" \"I tell you, sir,\" said Andrew Melville\r\non that occasion, \"there are two kings and two kingdoms in Scotland.\r\nThere is Christ Jesus the King, and his kingdom the Kirk, whose subject\r\nJames VI. is, and of whose kingdom not a king, nor a lord, nor a head,\r\nbut a member. And they whom Christ hath called to watch over his kirk\r\nand govern his spiritual kingdom have sufficient power and authority so\r\nto do both together and severally.\" In this bold and masterful speech\r\nwe have the whole political philosophy of Puritanism, as in a nutshell.\r\nUnder the guise of theocratic fanaticism, and in words as arrogant as\r\never fell from priestly lips, there was couched the assertion of the\r\npopular will against despotic privilege. Melville could say such things\r\nto the king\u0027s face and walk away unharmed, because there stood behind\r\nhim a people fully aroused to the conviction that there is an eternal\r\nlaw of God, which kings no less than scullions must obey. [3] Melville\r\nknew this full well, and so did James know it in the bitterness of his\r\nheart. He would have no such mischievous work in England. He despised\r\nElizabeth\u0027s grand national policy which his narrow intellect could not\r\ncomprehend. He could see that in fighting Spain and aiding Dutchmen and\r\nHuguenots she was strengthening the very spirit that sought to pull\r\nmonarchy down. In spite of her faults, which were neither few nor small,\r\nthe patriotism of that fearless woman was superior to any personal\r\nambition. It was quite otherwise with James. He was by no means\r\nfearless, and he cared more for James Stuart than for either England or\r\nScotland. He had an overweening opinion of his skill in kingcraft. In\r\ncoming to Westminster it was his policy to use his newly acquired\r\npower to break down the Puritan party in both kingdoms and to fasten\r\nepiscopacy upon Scotland. In pursuing this policy he took no heed of\r\nEnglish national sentiment, but was quite ready to defy and insult it,\r\neven to the point of making--before children who remembered the Armada\r\nhad yet reached middle age--an alliance with the hated Spaniard. In such\r\nwise James succeeded in arraying against the monarchical principle the\r\nstrongest forces of English life,--the sentiment of nationality, the\r\nsentiment of personal freedom, and the uncompromising religious fervour\r\nof Calvinism; and out of this invincible combination of forces has been\r\nwrought the nobler and happier state of society in which we live to-day.\r\n[Sidenote: James Stuart and Andrew Melville]\r\n\r\nScarcely ten months had James been king of England when he invited\r\nthe leading Puritan clergymen to meet himself and the bishops in a\r\nconference at Hampton Court, as he wished to learn what changes they\r\nwould like to make in the government and ritual of the church. In the\r\ncourse of the discussion he lost his temper and stormed, as was his\r\nwont. [Sidenote: King James\u0027s view of the political situation]\r\n\r\nThe mention of the word \"presbytery\" lashed him into fury. \"A Scottish\r\npresbytery,\" he cried, \"agreeth as well with a monarchy as God and the\r\nDevil. Then Jack and Tom and Will and Dick shall meet, and at their\r\npleasures censure me and my council and all our proceedings .... Stay,\r\nI pray you, for one seven years, before you demand that from me, and if\r\nthen you find me pursy and fat, and my windpipes stuffed, I will perhaps\r\nhearken to you .... Until you find that I grow lazy, let that alone.\"\r\nOne of the bishops declared that in this significant tirade his Majesty\r\nspoke by special inspiration from Heaven! The Puritans saw that their\r\nonly hope lay in resistance. If any doubt remained, it was dispelled by\r\nthe vicious threat with which the king broke up the conference. \"I will\r\n_make_ them conform,\" said he, \"or I will harry them out of the land.\"\r\n\r\nThese words made a profound sensation in England, as well they might,\r\nfor they heralded the struggle which within half a century was to\r\ndeliver up James\u0027s son to the executioner. The Parliament of 1604 met\r\nin angrier mood than any Parliament which had assembled at Westminster\r\nsince the dethronement of Richard II. Among the churches non-conformity\r\nbegan more decidedly to assume the form of secession. The key-note of\r\nthe conflict was struck at Scrooby. Staunch Puritan as he was, Brewster\r\nhad not hitherto favoured the extreme measures of the Separatists. Now\r\nhe withdrew from the church, and gathered together a company of men and\r\nwomen who met on Sundays for divine service in his own drawing-room at\r\nScrooby Manor. In organizing this independent Congregationalist\r\nsociety, Brewster was powerfully aided by John Robinson, a native of\r\nLincolnshire. Robinson was then thirty years of age, and had taken his\r\nmaster\u0027s degree at Cambridge in 1600. He was a man of great learning and\r\nrare sweetness of temper, and was moreover distinguished for a broad and\r\ntolerant habit of mind too seldom found among the Puritans of that day.\r\nFriendly and unfriendly writers alike bear witness to his spirit of\r\nChristian charity and the comparatively slight value which he attached\r\nto orthodoxy in points of doctrine; and we can hardly be wrong in\r\nsupposing that the comparatively tolerant behaviour of the Plymouth\r\ncolonists, whereby they were contrasted with the settlers of\r\nMassachusetts, was in some measure due to the abiding influence of the\r\nteachings of this admirable man. Another important member of the Scrooby\r\ncongregation was William Bradford, of the neighbouring village of\r\nAusterfield, then a lad of seventeen years, but already remarkable for\r\nmaturity of intelligence and weight of character. Afterward governor of\r\nPlymouth for nearly thirty years, he became the historian of his colony;\r\nand to his picturesque chronicle, written in pure and vigorous English,\r\nwe are indebted for most that we know of the migration that started\r\nfrom Scrooby and ended in Plymouth. [Sidenote: The congregation of\r\nSeparatists at Scrooby]\r\n\r\nIt was in 1606--two years after King James\u0027s truculent threat--that\r\nthis independent church of Scrooby was organized. Another year had not\r\nelapsed before its members had suffered so much at the hands of officers\r\nof the law, that they began to think of following the example of former\r\nheretics and escaping to Holland. After an unsuccessful attempt in\r\nthe autumn of 1607, they at length succeeded a few months later in\r\naccomplishing their flight to Amsterdam, where they hoped to find a\r\nhome. But here they found the English exiles who had preceded them so\r\nfiercely involved in doctrinal controversies, that they decided to\r\ngo further in search of peace and quiet. This decision, which we may\r\nascribe to Robinson\u0027s wise counsels, served to keep the society of\r\nPilgrims from getting divided and scattered. They reached Leyden in\r\n1609, just as the Spanish government had sullenly abandoned the hopeless\r\ntask of conquering the Dutch, and had granted to Holland the Twelve\r\nYears Truce. During eleven of these twelve years the Pilgrims remained\r\nin Leyden, supporting themselves by various occupations, while their\r\nnumbers increased from 300 to more than 1000. Brewster opened a\r\npublishing house, devoted mainly to the issue of theological books.\r\nRobinson accepted a professorship in the university, and engaged in the\r\ndefence of Calvinism against the attacks of Episcopius, the successor\r\nof Arminius. The youthful Bradford devoted himself to the study of\r\nlanguages,--Dutch, French, Latin, Greek, and finally Hebrew; wishing,\r\nas he said, to \"see with his own eyes the ancient oracles of God in all\r\ntheir native beauty.\" During their sojourn in Leyden the Pilgrims were\r\nintroduced to a strange and novel spectacle,--the systematic legal\r\ntoleration of all persons, whether Catholic or Protestant, who called\r\nthemselves followers of Christ. Not that there was not plenty of\r\nintolerance in spirit, but the policy inaugurated by the idolized\r\nWilliam the Silent held it in check by law. All persons who came to\r\nHolland, and led decorous lives there, were protected in their opinions\r\nand customs. By contemporary writers in other countries this eccentric\r\nbehaviour of the Dutch government was treated with unspeakable scorn.\r\n\"All strange religions flock thither,\" says one; it is \"a common harbour\r\nof all heresies,\" a \"cage of unclean birds,\" says another; \"the great\r\nmingle mangle of religion,\" says a third. [4] In spite of the relief\r\nfrom persecution, however, the Pilgrims were not fully satisfied with\r\ntheir new home. The expiration of the truce with Spain might prove that\r\nthis relief was only temporary; and at any rate, complete toleration\r\ndid not fill the measure of their wants. Had they come to Holland as\r\nscattered bands of refugees, they might have been absorbed into the\r\nDutch population, as Huguenot refugees have been absorbed in Germany,\r\nEngland, and America. But they had come as an organized community, and\r\nabsorption into a foreign nation was something to be dreaded. They\r\nwished to preserve their English speech and English traditions, keep up\r\ntheir organization, and find some favoured spot where they might lay the\r\ncorner-stone of a great Christian state. The spirit of nationality was\r\nstrong in them; the spirit of self-government was strong in them; and\r\nthe only thing which could satisfy these feelings was such a migration\r\nas had not been seen since ancient times, a migration like that of\r\nPhokaians to Massilia or Tyrians to Carthage. [Sidenote: The flight to\r\nHolland] [Sidenote: Why the Pilgrims did not stay there]\r\n\r\nIt was too late in the world\u0027s history to carry out such a scheme upon\r\nEuropean soil. Every acre of territory there was appropriated. The only\r\nfavourable outlook was upon the Atlantic coast of America, where English\r\ncruisers had now successfully disputed the pretensions of Spain, and\r\nwhere after forty years of disappointment and disaster a flourishing\r\ncolony had at length been founded in Virginia. The colonization of the\r\nNorth American coast had now become part of the avowed policy of the\r\nBritish government. In 1606 a great joint-stock company was formed for\r\nthe establishment of two colonies in America. The branch which was to\r\ntake charge of the proposed southern colony had its headquarters in\r\nLondon; the management of the northern branch was at Plymouth in\r\nDevonshire. Hence the two branches are commonly spoken of as the London\r\nand Plymouth companies. The former was also called the Virginia Company,\r\nand the latter the North Virginia Company, as the name of Virginia was\r\nthen loosely applied to the entire Atlantic coast north of Florida. The\r\nLondon Company had jurisdiction from 34 degrees to 38 degrees north\r\nlatitude; the Plymouth Company had jurisdiction from 45 degrees down to\r\n41 degrees; the intervening territory, between 38 degrees and 41 degrees\r\nwas to go to whichever company should first plant a self-supporting\r\ncolony. The local government of each colony was to be entrusted to a\r\ncouncil resident in America and nominated by the king; while general\r\nsupervision over both colonies was to be exercised by a council resident\r\nin England. [Sidenote: The London and Plymouth companies]\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this general plan, though with some variations in\r\ndetail, the settlement of Jamestown had been begun in 1607, and its\r\nsuccess was now beginning to seem assured. On the other hand all the\r\nattempts which had been made to the north of the fortieth parallel had\r\nfailed miserably. As early as 1602 Bartholomew Gosnold, with 32 men, had\r\nlanded on the headland which they named Cape Cod from the fish found\r\nthereabouts in great numbers. This was the first English name given to\r\nany spot in that part of America, and so far as known these were the\r\nfirst Englishmen that ever set foot there. They went on and gave names\r\nto Martha\u0027s Vineyard and the Elizabeth Islands in Buzzard\u0027s Bay; and\r\non Cuttyhunk they built some huts with the intention of remaining, but\r\nafter a month\u0027s experience they changed their mind and went back to\r\nEngland. Gosnold\u0027s story interested other captains, and on Easter\r\nSunday, 1605, George Weymouth set sail for North Virginia, as it was\r\ncalled. He found Cape Cod and coasted northward as far as the Kennebec\r\nriver, up which he sailed for many miles. Weymouth kidnapped five\r\nIndians and carried them to England, that they might learn the language\r\nand acquire a wholesome respect for the arts of civilization and the\r\nresistless power of white men. His glowing accounts of the spacious\r\nharbours, the abundance of fish and game, the noble trees, the luxuriant\r\nherbage, and the balmy climate, aroused general interest in England, and\r\ndoubtless had some influence upon the formation, in the following year,\r\nof the great joint-stock company just described. The leading spirit of\r\nthe Plymouth Company was Sir John Popham, chief-justice of England, and\r\nhe was not disposed to let his friends of the southern branch excel him\r\nin promptness. Within three months after the founding of Jamestown, a\r\nparty of 120 colonists, led by the judge\u0027s kinsman George Popham, landed\r\nat the mouth of the Kennebec, and proceeded to build a rude village of\r\nsome fifty cabins, with storehouse, chapel, and block-house. When\r\nthey landed in August they doubtless shared Weymouth\u0027s opinion of the\r\nclimate. These Englishmen had heard of warm countries like Italy and\r\ncold countries like Russia; harsh experience soon taught them that there\r\nare climates in which the summer of Naples may alternate with the winter\r\nof Moscow. The president and many others fell sick and died. News came\r\nof the death of Sir John Popham in England, and presently the weary and\r\ndisappointed settlers abandoned their enterprise and returned to their\r\nold homes. Their failure spread abroad in England the opinion that\r\nNorth Virginia was uninhabitable by reason of the cold, and no further\r\nattempts were made upon that coast until in 1614 it was visited by\r\nCaptain John Smith. [Sidenote: First exploration of the New England\r\ncoast]\r\n\r\nThe romantic career of this gallant and garrulous hero did not end with\r\nhis departure from the infant colony at Jamestown. By a curious destiny\r\nhis fame is associated with the beginnings of both the southern and the\r\nnorthern portions of the United States. To Virginia Smith may be said to\r\nhave given its very existence as a commonwealth; to New England he\r\ngave its name. In 1614 he came over with two ships to North Virginia,\r\nexplored its coast minutely from the Penobscot river to Cape Cod, and\r\nthinking it a country of such extent and importance as to deserve a name\r\nof its own, rechristened it New England. On returning home he made a\r\nvery good map of the coast and dotted it with English names suggested by\r\nPrince Charles. Of these names Cape Elizabeth, Cape Ann, Charles River,\r\nand Plymouth still remain where Smith placed them. In 1615 Smith again\r\nset sail for the New World, this time with a view to planting a colony\r\nunder the auspices of the Plymouth Company, but his talent for strange\r\nadventures had not deserted him. He was taken prisoner by a French\r\nfleet, carried hither and thither on a long cruise, and finally set\r\nashore at Rochelle, whence, without a penny in his pocket, he contrived\r\nto make his way back to England. Perhaps Smith\u0027s life of hardship may\r\nhave made him prematurely old. After all his wild and varied experience\r\nhe was now only in his thirty-seventh year, but he does not seem to have\r\ngone on any more voyages. The remaining sixteen years of his life\r\nwere spent quietly in England in writing books, publishing maps, and\r\notherwise stimulating the public interest in the colonization of the New\r\nWorld. But as for the rocky coast of New England, which he had explored\r\nand named, he declared that he was not so simple as to suppose that any\r\nother motive than riches would \"ever erect there a commonwealth or draw\r\ncompany from their ease and humours at home, to stay in New England.\"\r\n[Sidenote: John Smith]\r\n\r\nIn this opinion, however, the bold explorer was mistaken. Of all\r\nmigrations of peoples the settlement of New England is preeminently\r\nthe one in which the almighty dollar played the smallest part, however\r\nimportant it may since have become as a motive power. It was left for\r\nreligious enthusiasm to achieve what commercial enterprise had failed\r\nto accomplish. By the summer of 1617 the Pilgrim society at Leyden had\r\ndecided to send a detachment of its most vigorous members to lay\r\nthe foundations of a Puritan state in America. There had been much\r\ndiscussion as to the fittest site for such a colony. Many were in favour\r\nof Guiana, which Sir Walter Raleigh had described in such glowing\r\ncolours; but it was thought that the tropical climate would be\r\nill-suited to northern men of industrious and thrifty habit, and the\r\nsituation, moreover, was dangerously exposed to the Spaniards. Half a\r\ncentury had scarcely elapsed since the wholesale massacre of Huguenots\r\nin Florida. Virginia was then talked of, but Episcopal ideas had already\r\ntaken root there. New England, on the other hand, was considered too\r\ncold. Popham\u0027s experience was not encouraging. But the country about\r\nthe Delaware river afforded an opportunity for erecting an independent\r\ncolony under the jurisdiction of the London Company, and this seemed\r\nthe best course to pursue. Sir Edwin Sandys, the leading spirit in the\r\nLondon Company, was favourably inclined toward Puritans, and through him\r\nnegotiations were begun. Capital to the amount of £7000 was furnished\r\nby seventy merchant adventurers in England, and the earnings of the\r\nsettlers were to be thrown into a common stock until these subscribers\r\nshould have been remunerated. A grant of land was obtained from the\r\nLondon Company, and the king was asked to protect the emigrants by a\r\ncharter, but this was refused. James, however, made no objections to\r\ntheir going, herein showing himself less of a bigot than Louis XIV.\r\nin later days, who would not suffer a Huguenot to set foot in Canada,\r\nthough France was teeming with Huguenots who would have been glad\r\nenough to go. When James inquired how the colonists expected to support\r\nthemselves, some one answered, most likely by fishing. \"Very good,\"\r\nquoth the king, \"it was the Apostles\u0027 own calling.\" He declared that no\r\none should molest them so long as they behaved themselves properly. From\r\nthis unwonted urbanity it would appear that James anticipated no trouble\r\nfrom the new colony. A few Puritans in America could not do much to\r\nannoy him, and there was of course a fair chance of their perishing, as\r\nso many other colonizers had perished. [Sidenote: The Pilgrims at Leyden\r\ndecide to make a settlement near the Delaware river]\r\n\r\nThe congregation at Leyden did not think it wise to cut loose from\r\nHolland until they should have secured a foothold in America. It was but\r\nan advance guard that started out from Delft haven late in July, 1620,\r\nin the rickety ship Speedwell, with Brewster and Bradford, and sturdy\r\nMiles Standish, a trained soldier whose aid was welcome, though he does\r\nnot seem to have belonged to the congregation. Robinson remained at\r\nLeyden, and never came to America. After a brief stop at Southampton,\r\nwhere they met the Mayflower with friends from London, the Pilgrims\r\nagain set sail in the two ships. The Speedwell sprang a leak, and they\r\nstopped at Dartmouth for repairs. Again they started, and had put three\r\nhundred miles of salt water between themselves and Land\u0027s End, when the\r\nSpeedwell leaked so badly that they were forced to return. When they\r\ndropped anchor at Plymouth in Devonshire, about twenty were left on\r\nshore, and the remainder, exactly one hundred in number, crowded into\r\nthe Mayflower and on the 6th of September started once more to cross the\r\nAtlantic. The capacity of the little ship was 180 tons, and her strength\r\nwas but slight. In a fierce storm in mid-ocean a mainbeam amidships was\r\nwrenched and cracked, and but for a huge iron screw which one of the\r\npassengers had brought from Delft, they might have gone to the bottom.\r\nThe foul weather prevented any accurate calculation of latitude and\r\nlongitude, and they were so far out in their reckoning that when they\r\ncaught sight of land on the 9th of November, it was to Cape Cod that\r\nthey had come. Their patent gave them no authority to settle here, as\r\nit was beyond the jurisdiction of the London Company. They turned their\r\nprow southward, but encountering perilous shoals and a stiff headwind\r\nthey desisted and sought shelter in Cape Cod bay. On the 11th they\r\ndecided to find some place of abode in this neighbourhood, anticipating\r\nno difficulty in getting a patent from the Plymouth Company, which was\r\nanxious to obtain settlers. For five weeks they stayed in the ship while\r\nlittle parties were exploring the coast and deciding upon the best site\r\nfor a town. It was purely a coincidence that the spot which they chose\r\nhad already received from John Smith the name of Plymouth, the beautiful\r\nport in Devonshire from which the Mayflower had sailed. [Sidenote:\r\nFounding of Plymouth]\r\n\r\nThere was not much to remind them of home in the snow-covered coast on\r\nwhich they landed. They had hoped to get their rude houses built before\r\nthe winter should set in, but the many delays and mishaps had served to\r\nbring them ashore in the coldest season. When the long winter came to\r\nan end, fifty-one of the hundred Pilgrims had died,--a mortality even\r\ngreater than that before which the Popham colony had succumbed. But\r\nBrewster spoke truth when he said, \"It is not with us as with men whom\r\nsmall things can discourage or small discontentments cause to wish\r\nthemselves at home again.\" At one time the living were scarcely able to\r\nbury the dead; only Brewster, Standish, and five other hardy ones were\r\nwell enough to get about. At first they were crowded under a single\r\nroof, and as glimpses were caught of dusky savages skulking among the\r\ntrees, a platform was built on the nearest hill and a few cannon were\r\nplaced there in such wise as to command the neighbouring valleys and\r\nplains. By the end of the first summer the platform had grown to a\r\nfortress, down from which to the harbour led a village street with seven\r\nhouses finished and others going up. Twenty-six acres had been cleared,\r\nand a plentiful harvest gathered in; venison, wild fowl, and fish were\r\neasy to obtain. When provisions and fuel had been laid in for the\r\nensuing winter, Governor Bradford appointed a day of Thanksgiving.\r\nTown-meetings had already been held, and a few laws passed. The history\r\nof New England had begun.\r\n\r\nThis had evidently been a busy summer for the forty-nine survivors.\r\nOn the 9th of November, the anniversary of the day on which they had\r\nsighted land, a ship was descried in the offing. She was the Fortune,\r\nbringing some fifty more of the Leyden company. It was a welcome\r\nreinforcement, but it diminished the rations of food that could be\r\nserved during the winter, for the Fortune was not well supplied. When\r\nshe set sail for England, she carried a little cargo of beaver-skins and\r\nchoice wood for wainscoting to the value of L500 sterling, as a first\r\ninstalment of the sum due to the merchant adventurers. But this cargo\r\nnever reached England, for the Fortune was overhauled by a French\r\ncruiser and robbed of everything worth carrying away.\r\n\r\nFor two years more it was an anxious and difficult time for the new\r\ncolony. By 1624 its success may be said to have become assured. That the\r\nIndians in the neighbourhood had not taken advantage of the distress of\r\nthe settlers in that first winter, and massacred every one of them, was\r\ndue to a remarkable circumstance. Early in 1617 a frightful pestilence\r\nhad swept over New England and slain, it is thought, more than half the\r\nIndian population between the Penobscot river and Narragansett bay. Many\r\nof the Indians were inclined to attribute this calamity to the murder of\r\ntwo or three white fishermen the year before. They had not got over the\r\nsuperstitious dread with which the first sight of white men had inspired\r\nthem, and now they believed that the strangers held the demon of the\r\nplague at their disposal and had let him loose upon the red men in\r\nrevenge for the murders they had committed. This wholesome delusion\r\nkept their tomahawks quiet for a while. When they saw the Englishmen\r\nestablishing themselves at Plymouth, they at first held a powwow in\r\nthe forest, at which the new-comers were cursed with all the elaborate\r\ningenuity that the sorcery of the medicine-men could summon for so\r\nmomentous an occasion; but it was deemed best to refrain from merely\r\nhuman methods of attack. It was not until the end of the first winter\r\nthat any of them mustered courage to visit the palefaces. Then an Indian\r\nnamed Samoset, who had learned a little English from fishermen and for\r\nhis own part was inclined to be friendly, came one day into the\r\nvillage with words of welcome. He was so kindly treated that presently\r\nMassasoit, principal sachem of the Wampanoags, who dwelt between\r\nNarragansett and Cape Cod bays, came with a score of painted and\r\nfeathered warriors and squatting on a green rug and cushions in the\r\ngovernor\u0027s log-house smoked the pipe of peace, while Standish with\r\nhalf-a-dozen musketeers stood quietly by. An offensive and defensive\r\nalliance was then and there made between King Massasoit and King James,\r\nand the treaty was faithfully kept for half a century. Some time\r\nafterward, when Massasoit had fallen sick and lay at death\u0027s door, his\r\nlife was saved by Edward Winslow, who came to his wigwam and skilfully\r\nnursed him. Henceforth the Wampanoag thought well of the Pilgrim. The\r\npowerful Narragansetts, who dwelt on the farther side of the bay, felt\r\ndifferently, and thought it worth while to try the effect of a threat.\r\nA little while after the Fortune had brought its reinforcement, the\r\nNarragansett sachem Canonicus sent a messenger to Plymouth with a bundle\r\nof newly-made arrows wrapped in a snake-skin. The messenger threw it\r\nin at the governor\u0027s door and made off with unseemly haste. Bradford\r\nunderstood this as a challenge, and in this he was confirmed by a\r\nfriendly Wampanoag. The Narragansetts could muster 2000 warriors, for\r\nwhom forty or fifty Englishmen, even with firearms, were hardly a fair\r\nmatch; but it would not do to show fear. Bradford stuffed the snake-skin\r\nwith powder and bullets, and sent it back to Canonicus, telling him that\r\nif he wanted war he might come whenever he liked and get his fill of it.\r\nWhen the sachem saw what the skin contained, he was afraid to touch\r\nit or have it about, and medicine-men, handling it no doubt gingerly\r\nenough, carried it out of his territory. [Sidenote: Why the colony was\r\nnot attacked by the Indians]\r\n\r\nIt was a fortunate miscalculation that brought the Pilgrims to New\r\nEngland. Had they ventured upon the lands between the Hudson and the\r\nDelaware, they would probably have fared worse. They would soon have\r\ncome into collision with the Dutch, and not far from that neighbourhood\r\ndwelt the Susquehannocks, at that time one of the most powerful and\r\nferocious tribes on the continent. For the present the new-comers were\r\nless likely to be molested in the Wampanoag country than anywhere else.\r\nIn the course of the year 1621 they obtained their grant from the\r\nPlymouth Company. This grant was not made to them directly but to\r\nthe joint-stock company of merchant adventurers with whom they were\r\nassociated. But the alliance between the Pilgrims and these London\r\nmerchants was not altogether comfortable; there was too much divergence\r\nbetween their aims. In 1627 the settlers, wishing to be entirely\r\nindependent, bought up all the stock and paid for it by instalments\r\nfrom the fruits of their labour. By 1633 they had paid every penny, and\r\nbecome the undisputed owners of the country they had occupied.\r\n\r\nSuch was the humble beginning of that great Puritan exodus from England\r\nto America which had so much to do with founding and peopling the United\r\nStates. These Pilgrims of the Mayflower were but the pioneers of a\r\nmighty host. Historically their enterprise is interesting not so much\r\nfor what it achieved as for what it suggested. Of itself the Plymouth\r\ncolony could hardly have become a wealthy and powerful state. Its growth\r\nwas extremely slow. After ten years its numbers were but three hundred.\r\nIn 1643, when the exodus had come to an end, and the New England\r\nConfederacy was formed, the population of Plymouth was but three\r\nthousand. In an established community, indeed, such a rate of increase\r\nwould be rapid, but it was not sufficient to raise in New England a\r\npower which could overcome Indians and Dutchmen and Frenchmen, and\r\nassert its will in opposition to the crown. It is when we view the\r\nfounding of Plymouth in relation to what came afterward, that it assumes\r\nthe importance which belongs to the beginning of a new era.\r\n\r\nWe have thus seen how it was that the political aspirations of James I.\r\ntoward absolute sovereignty resulted in the beginnings of the Puritan\r\nexodus to America. In the next chapter we shall see how the still more\r\narbitrary policy of his ill-fated son all at once gave new dimensions to\r\nthat exodus and resulted in the speedy planting of a high-spirited and\r\npowerful New England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE PLANTING OF NEW ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Captain George Weymouth in the summer of 1605 sailed into the\r\nharbour of Plymouth in Devonshire, with his five kidnapped savages and\r\nhis glowing accounts of the country since known as New England, the\r\ngarrison of that fortified seaport was commanded by Sir Ferdinando\r\nGorges. The Christian name of this person now strikes us as rather odd,\r\nbut in those days it was not so uncommon in England, and it does not\r\nnecessarily indicate a Spanish or Italian ancestry for its bearer.\r\nGorges was a man of considerable ability, but not of high character. On\r\nthe downfall of his old patron the Earl of Essex he had contrived to\r\nsave his own fortunes by a course of treachery and ingratitude. He had\r\nserved in the Dutch war against Spain, and since 1596 had been military\r\ngovernor of Plymouth. The sight of Weymouth\u0027s Indians and the recital of\r\nhis explorations awakened the interest of Gorges in the colonization of\r\nNorth America. He became one of the most active members of the Plymouth,\r\nor North Virginia, Company established in the following year. It was he\r\nwho took the leading part in fitting out the two ships with which John\r\nSmith started on his unsuccessful expedition in 1615. In the following\r\nyears he continued to send out voyages of exploration, became largely\r\ninterested in the fisheries, and at length in 1620 succeeded in\r\nobtaining a new patent for the Plymouth Company, by which it was made\r\nindependent of the London Company, its old yoke-fellow and rival. This\r\nnew document created a corporation of forty patentees who, sitting in\r\ncouncil as directors of their enterprise, were known as the Council for\r\nNew England. The president of this council was King James\u0027s unpopular\r\nfavourite the Duke of Buckingham, and its most prominent members\r\nwere the earls of Pembroke and Lenox, Sir Ferdinando Gorges, and\r\nShakespeare\u0027s friend the Earl of Southampton. This council was empowered\r\nto legislate for its American territory, to exercise martial law there\r\nand expel all intruders, and to exercise a monopoly of trade within the\r\nlimits of the patent. Such extensive powers, entrusted to a company of\r\nwhich Buckingham was the head, excited popular indignation, and in the\r\ngreat struggle against monopolies which was then going on, the Plymouth\r\nCompany did not fail to serve as a target for attacks. It started,\r\nhowever, with too little capital to enter upon schemes involving\r\nimmediate outlay, and began almost from the first to seek to increase\r\nits income by letting or selling portions of its territory, which\r\nextended from the latitude of Philadelphia to that of Quebec, thus\r\nencroaching upon regions where Holland and France were already gaining\r\na foothold. It was from this company that the merchant adventurers\r\nassociated with the Mayflower Pilgrims obtained their new patent in\r\nthe summer of 1621, and for the next fifteen years all settlers in New\r\nEngland based their claims to the soil upon territorial rights conveyed\r\nto them by the Plymouth Company. The grants, however, were often\r\nignorantly and sometimes unscrupulously made, and their limits were so\r\nill-defined that much quarrelling ensued. [Sidenote: Sir Ferdinando\r\nGorges, and the Council for New England]\r\n\r\nDuring the years immediately following the voyage of the Mayflower,\r\nseveral attempts at settlement were made about the shores of\r\nMassachusetts bay. One of the merchant adventurers, Thomas Weston, took\r\nit into his head in 1622 to separate from his partners and send out a\r\ncolony of seventy men on his own account. These men made a settlement\r\nat Wessagusset, some twenty-five miles north of Plymouth. They were a\r\ndisorderly, thriftless rabble, picked up from the London streets, and\r\nsoon got into trouble with the Indians; after a year they were glad\r\nto get back to England as best they could, and in this the Plymouth\r\nsettlers willingly aided them. In June of that same year 1622 there\r\narrived on the scene a picturesque but ill understood personage, Thomas\r\nMorton, \"of Clifford\u0027s Inn, Gent.,\" as he tells on the title-page of\r\nhis quaint and delightful book, the \"New English Canaan.\" Bradford\r\ndisparagingly says that he \"had been a kind of petie-fogger of\r\nFurnifell\u0027s Inn\"; but the churchman Samuel Maverick declares that he\r\nwas a \"gentleman of good qualitie.\" He was an agent of Sir Ferdinando\r\nGorges, and came with some thirty followers to make the beginnings of\r\na royalist and Episcopal settlement in the Massachusetts bay. He was\r\nnaturally regarded with ill favour by the Pilgrims as well as by the\r\nlater Puritan settlers, and their accounts of him will probably\r\nbear taking with a grain or two of salt. [Sidenote: Wessagusset and\r\nMerrymount]\r\n\r\nIn 1625 there came one Captain Wollaston, with a gang of indented white\r\nservants, and established himself on the site of the present town\r\nof Quincy. Finding this system of industry ill suited to northern\r\nagriculture, he carried most of his men off to Virginia, where he sold\r\nthem. Morton took possession of the site of the settlement, which he\r\ncalled Merrymount. There, according to Bradford, he set up a \"schoole of\r\nathisme,\" and his men did quaff strong waters and comport themselves \"as\r\nif they had anew revived and celebrated the feasts of ye Roman Goddes\r\nFlora, or the beastly practices of ye madd Bachanalians.\" Charges of\r\natheism have been freely hurled about in all ages. In Morton\u0027s case the\r\naccusation seems to have been based upon the fact that he used the Book\r\nof Common Prayer. His men so far maintained the ancient customs of\r\nmerry England as to plant a Maypole eighty feet high, about which they\r\nfrolicked with the redskins, while furthermore they taught them the\r\nuse of firearms and sold them muskets and rum. This was positively\r\ndangerous, and in the summer of 1628 the settlers at Merrymount were\r\ndispersed by Miles Standish. Morton was sent to England, but returned\r\nthe next year, and presently again repaired to Merrymount.\r\n\r\nBy this time other settlements were dotted about the coast. There were\r\na few scattered cottages or cabins at Nantasket and at the mouth of the\r\nPiscataqua, while Samuel Maverick had fortified himself on Noddle\u0027s\r\nIsland, and William Blackstone already lived upon the Shawmut peninsula,\r\nsince called Boston. These two gentlemen were no friends to the\r\nPuritans; they were churchmen and representatives of Sir Ferdinando\r\nGorges.\r\n\r\nThe case was very different with another of these earliest settlements,\r\nwhich deserves especial mention as coming directly in the line of\r\ncausation which led to the founding of Massachusetts by Puritans. For\r\nsome years past the Dorchester adventurers--a small company of merchants\r\nin the shire town of Dorset--had been sending vessels to catch fish off\r\nthe New England coast. In 1623 these men conceived the idea of planting\r\na small village as a fishing station, and setting up a church and\r\npreacher therein, for the spiritual solace of the fishermen and sailors.\r\nIn pursuance of this scheme a small party occupied Cape Ann, where after\r\ntwo years they got into trouble with the men of Plymouth. Several grants\r\nand assignments had made it doubtful where the ownership lay, and\r\nalthough this place was not near their own town, the men of Plymouth\r\nclaimed it. The dispute was amicably arranged by Roger Conant, an\r\nindependent settler who had withdrawn from Plymouth because he did not\r\nfully sympathize with the Separatist views of the people there. The\r\nnext step was for the Dorchester adventurers to appoint Conant as their\r\nmanager, and the next was for them to abandon their enterprise, dissolve\r\ntheir partnership, and leave the remnant of the little colony to shift\r\nfor itself. The settlers retained their tools and cattle, and Conant\r\nfound for them a new and safer situation at Naumkeag, on the site of the\r\npresent Salem. So far little seemed to have been accomplished; one more\r\nseemed added to the list of failures.\r\n\r\nBut the excellent John White, the Puritan rector of Trinity Church in\r\nDorchester, had meditated carefully about these things. He saw that\r\nmany attempts at colonization had failed because they made use of unfit\r\ninstruments, \"a multitude of rude ungovernable persons, the very scum of\r\nthe land.\" So Virginia had failed in its first years, and only succeeded\r\nwhen settled by worthy and industrious people under a strong government.\r\nThe example of Plymouth, as contrasted with Wessagusset, taught a\r\nsimilar lesson. We desire, said White, \"to raise a bulwark against the\r\nkingdom of Antichrist.\" Learn wisdom, my countrymen, from the ruin which\r\nhas befallen the Protestants at Rochelle and in the Palatinate; learn\r\n\"to avoid the plague while it is foreseen, and not to tarry as they did\r\ntill it overtook them.\" The Puritan party in England was numerous and\r\npowerful, but the day of strife was not far off and none might foretell\r\nits issue. Clearly it was well to establish a strong and secure retreat\r\nin the New World, in case of disaster in the Old. What had been done at\r\nPlymouth by a few men of humble means might be done on a much greater\r\nscale by an association of leading Puritans, including men of wealth and\r\nwide social influence. Such arguments were urged in timely pamphlets, of\r\none of which White is supposed to have been the author. The matter was\r\ndiscussed in London, and inquiry was made whether fit men could be found\r\n\"to engage their persons in the voyage.\" \"It fell out that among others\r\nthey lighted at last on Master Endicott, a man well known to divers\r\npersons of good note, who manifested much willingness to accept of the\r\noffer as soon as it was tendered.\" All were thereby much encouraged, the\r\nschemes of White took definite shape, and on the 19th of March, 1628, a\r\ntract of land was obtained from the Council for New England, consisting\r\nof all the territory included between three miles north of the Merrimack\r\nand three miles south of the Charles in one direction, and the Atlantic\r\nand Pacific Oceans in the other. [Sidenote: John White and his noble\r\nscheme]\r\n\r\nThis liberal grant was made at a time when people still supposed the\r\nPacific coast to be not far west of Henry Hudson\u0027s river. The territory\r\nwas granted to an association of six gentlemen, only one of whom--John\r\nEndicott--figures conspicuously in the history of New England. The\r\ngrant was made in the usual reckless style, and conflicted with various\r\npatents which had been issued before. In 1622 Gorges and John Mason\r\nhad obtained a grant of all the land between the rivers Kennebec\r\nand Merrimack, and the new grant encroached somewhat upon this. The\r\ndifficulty seems to have been temporarily adjusted by some sort of\r\ncompromise which restricted the new grant to the Merrimack, for in 1629\r\nwe find Mason\u0027s title confirmed to the region between that river and the\r\nPiscataqua, while later on Gorges appears as proprietor of the territory\r\nbetween the Piscataqua and the Kennebec. A more serious difficulty was\r\nthe claim of Robert Gorges, son of Sir Ferdinando. That young man had in\r\n1623 obtained a grant of some 300 square miles in Massachusetts, and had\r\ngone to look after it, but had soon returned discouraged to England\r\nand shortly afterward died. But his claim devolved upon his surviving\r\nbrother, John Gorges, and Sir Ferdinando, in consenting to the grant to\r\nEndicott and his friends, expressly reserved the rights of his sons. No\r\nsuch reservation, however, was mentioned in the Massachusetts charter,\r\nand the colonists never paid the slightest heed to it. In these\r\nconflicting claims were sown seeds of trouble which bore fruit for more\r\nthan half a century. In such cases actual possession is apt to make nine\r\npoints in the law, and accordingly Endicott was sent over, as soon as\r\npossible, with sixty persons, to reinforce the party at Naumkeag and\r\nsupersede Conant as its leader. On Endicott\u0027s arrival in September,\r\n1628, the settlers were at first inclined to dispute his authority, but\r\nthey were soon conciliated, and in token of this amicable adjustment the\r\nplace was called by the Hebrew name of Salem, or \"peace.\" [Sidenote:\r\nConflicting grants sow seeds of trouble] [Sidenote: John Endicot and the\r\nfounding of Salem]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. White and the partners in England were pushing things\r\nvigorously. Their scheme took a wider scope. They were determined to\r\nestablish something more than a trading company. From Charles I. it\r\nwas sometimes easy to get promises because he felt himself under no\r\nobligation to keep them. In March, 1629, a royal charter was granted,\r\ncreating a corporation, under the legal style of the Governor and\r\nCompany of Massachusetts Bay in New England. The affairs of this\r\ncorporate body were to be managed by a governor, deputy-governor, and a\r\ncouncil of eighteen assistants, to be elected annually by the company.\r\nThey were empowered to make such laws as they liked for their settlers,\r\nprovided they did not contravene the laws of England,--a proviso\r\nsusceptible of much latitude of interpretation. The place where the\r\ncompany was to hold its meetings was not mentioned in the charter. The\r\nlaw-officers of the crown at first tried to insert a condition that\r\nthe government must reside in England, but the grantees with skilful\r\nargument succeeding in preventing this. Nothing was said in the charter\r\nabout religious liberty, for a twofold reason: the crown would not have\r\ngranted it, and it was not what the grantees wanted; such a provision\r\nwould have been liable to hamper them seriously in carrying out their\r\nscheme. They preferred to keep in their own hands the question as to how\r\nmuch or how little religious liberty they should claim or allow. Six\r\nsmall ships were presently fitted out, and upon them were embarked 300\r\nmen, 80 women, and 26 children, with 140 head of cattle, 40 goats, and\r\nabundance of arms, ammunition, and tools. The principal leader of this\r\ncompany was Francis Higginson, of St. John\u0027s College, Cambridge, rector\r\nof a church in Leicestershire, who had been deprived of his living for\r\nnon-conformity. With him were associated two other ministers, also\r\ngraduates of Cambridge. All three were members of the council. By the\r\narrival of this company at Salem, Endicott now became governor of a\r\ncolony larger than any yet started in New England,--larger than Plymouth\r\nafter its growth of nearly nine years. [Sidenote: The Company of\r\nMassachusetts Bay]\r\n\r\nThe time was at length ripe for that great Puritan exodus of which the\r\nvoyage of the Mayflower had been the premonitory symptom. The grand\r\ncrisis for the Puritans had come, the moment when decisive action could\r\nno longer be deferred. It was not by accident that the rapid development\r\nof John White\u0027s enterprise into the Company of Massachusetts Bay\r\ncoincided exactly with the first four years of the reign of Charles I.\r\nThey were years well fitted to bring such a scheme to quick maturity.\r\nThe character of Charles was such as to exacerbate the evils of his\r\nfather\u0027s reign. James could leave some things alone in the comfortable\r\nhope that all would by and by come out right, but Charles was not\r\nsatisfied without meddling everywhere. Both father and son cherished\r\nsome good intentions; both were sincere believers in their narrow theory\r\nof kingcraft. For wrong-headed obstinacy, utter want of tact, and\r\nbottomless perfidy, there was little to choose between them. The\r\nhumorous epitaph of the grandson \"whose word no man relies on\" might\r\nhave served for them all. But of this unhappy family Charles I. was\r\neminently the dreamer. He lived in a world of his own, and was slow\r\nin rendering thought into action; and this made him rely upon the\r\nquick-witted but unwise and unscrupulous Buckingham, [5] who was silly\r\nenough to make feeble attempts at unpopular warfare without consulting\r\nParliament. During each of Charles\u0027s first four years there was an\r\nangry session of Parliament, in which, through the unwillingness of the\r\npopular leaders to resort to violence, the king\u0027s policy seemed able\r\nto hold its ground. Despite all protest the king persisted in levying\r\nstrange taxes and was to some extent able to collect them. Men who\r\nrefused to pay enforced loans were thrown into jail and the writ of\r\n_habeas corpus_ was denied them. Meanwhile the treatment of Puritans\r\nbecame more and more vexatious. It was clear enough that Charles meant\r\nto become an absolute monarch, like Louis XIII., but Parliament began\r\nby throwing all the blame upon the unpopular minister and seeking to\r\nimpeach him.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of June, 1628, the House of Commons presented the most\r\nextraordinary spectacle, perhaps in all its history. The famous Petition\r\nof Right had been Passed by both Houses, and the royal answer had just\r\nbeen received. Its tone was that of gracious assent, but it omitted the\r\nnecessary legal formalities, and the Commons well knew what this meant.\r\nThey were to be tricked with sweet words, and the petition was not to\r\nacquire the force of a statute. How was it possible to deal with such a\r\nslippery creature? There was but one way of saving the dignity of the\r\nthrone without sacrificing the liberty of the people, and that was to\r\nhold the king\u0027s ministers responsible to Parliament, in anticipation\r\nof modern methods. It was accordingly proposed to impeach the Duke\r\nof Buckingham before the House of Lords. The Speaker now \"brought an\r\nimperious message from the king, ... warning them ... that he would not\r\ntolerate any aspersion upon his ministers.\" Nothing daunted by this,\r\nSir John Eliot arose to lead the debate, when the Speaker called him to\r\norder in view of the king\u0027s message. \"Amid a deadly stillness\" Eliot\r\nsat down and burst into tears. For a moment the House was overcome\r\nwith despair. Deprived of all constitutional methods of redress, they\r\nsuddenly saw yawning before them the direful alternative--slavery or\r\ncivil war. Since the day of Bosworth a hundred and fifty years had\r\npassed without fighting worthy of mention on English soil, such an era\r\nof peace as had hardly ever before been seen on the earth; now half the\r\nnation was to be pitted against the other half, families were to be\r\ndivided against themselves, as in the dreadful days of the Roses, and\r\nwith what consequences no one could foresee. \"Let us sit in silence,\"\r\nquoth Sir Dudley Digges, \"we are miserable, we know not what to do!\"\r\nNay, cried Sir Nathaniel Rich, \"we _must_ now speak, or forever hold our\r\npeace.\" Then did grim Mr. Prynne and Sir Edward Coke mingle their words\r\nwith sobs, while there were few dry eyes in the House. Presently they\r\nfound their voices, and used them in a way that wrung from the startled\r\nking his formal assent to the Petition of Right. [Sidenote: Remarkable\r\nscene in the House of Commons]\r\n\r\nThere is something strangely pathetic and historically significant [6]\r\nin the emotion of these stern, fearless men. The scene was no less\r\nstriking on the 2d of the following March, when, \"amid the cries and\r\nentreaties of the Speaker held down in his chair by force,\" while the\r\nUsher of the Black Rod was knocking loudly at the bolted door, and the\r\ntramp of the king\u0027s soldiers was heard in the courtyard, Eliot\u0027s clear\r\nvoice rang out the defiance that whoever advised the levy of tonnage and\r\npoundage without a grant from Parliament, or whoever voluntarily paid\r\nthose duties, was to be counted an enemy to the kingdom and a betrayer\r\nof its liberties. As shouts of \"Aye, aye,\" resounded on every side, \"the\r\ndoors were flung open, and the members poured forth in a throng.\" The\r\nnoble Eliot went to end his days in the Tower, and for eleven years no\r\nParliament sat again in England. [7]\r\n\r\nIt was in one and the same week that Charles I. thus began his\r\nexperiment of governing without a Parliament, and that he granted a\r\ncharter to the Company of Massachusetts Bay. He was very far, as we\r\nshall see, from realizing the import of what he was doing. To the\r\nPuritan leaders it was evident that a great struggle was at hand.\r\nAffairs at home might well seem desperate, and the news from abroad was\r\nnot encouraging. It was only four months since the surrender of Rochelle\r\nhad ended the existence of the Huguenots as an armed political party.\r\nThey had now sunk into the melancholy condition of a tolerated sect\r\nwhich may at any moment cease to be tolerated. In Germany the\r\nterrible Thirty Years War had just reached the darkest moment for\r\nthe Protestants. Fifteen months were yet to pass before the immortal\r\nGustavus was to cross the Baltic and give to the sorely harassed cause\r\nof liberty a fresh lease of life. The news of the cruel Edict of\r\nRestitution in this same fateful month of March, 1629, could not but\r\ngive the English Puritans great concern. Everywhere in Europe the\r\nchampions of human freedom seemed worsted. They might well think that\r\nnever had the prospect looked so dismal; and never before, as never\r\nsince, did the venture of a wholesale migration to the New World so\r\nstrongly recommend itself as the only feasible escape from a situation\r\nthat was fast becoming intolerable. Such were the anxious thoughts of\r\nthe leading Puritans in the spring of 1629, and in face of so grave a\r\nproblem different minds came naturally to different conclusions. Some\r\nwere for staying in England to fight it out to the bitter end; some were\r\nfor crossing the ocean to create a new England in the wilderness. Either\r\ntask was arduous enough, and not to be achieved without steadfast and\r\nsober heroism. [Sidenote: Desperate nature of the crisis]\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of August twelve gentlemen, among the most eminent in the\r\nPuritan party, held a meeting at Cambridge, and resolved to lead a\r\nmigration to New England, provided the charter of the Massachusetts Bay\r\nCompany and the government established under it could be transferred to\r\nthat country. On examination it appeared that no legal obstacle stood in\r\nthe way. Accordingly such of the old officers as did not wish to take\r\npart in the emigration resigned their places, which were forthwith\r\nfilled by these new leaders. For governor the choice fell upon John\r\nWinthrop, a wealthy gentleman from Groton in Suffolk, who was henceforth\r\nto occupy the foremost place among the founders of New England. Winthrop\r\nwas at this time forty-one years of age, having been born in the\r\nmemorable year of the Armada. He was a man of remarkable strength and\r\nbeauty of character, grave and modest, intelligent and scholarlike,\r\nintensely religious and endowed with a moral sensitiveness that was\r\nalmost morbid, yet liberal withal in his opinions and charitable in\r\ndisposition. When his life shall have been adequately written, as it\r\nnever has been, he will be recognized as one of the very noblest figures\r\nin American history. From early youth he had that same power of\r\nwinning confidence and commanding respect for which Washington was so\r\nremarkable; and when he was selected as the Moses of the great Puritan\r\nexodus, there was a wide-spread feeling that extraordinary results were\r\nlikely to come of such an enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn marked contrast to Winthrop stands the figure of the man associated\r\nwith him as deputy-governor. Thomas Dudley came of an ancient family,\r\nthe history of which, alike in the old and in the new England, has not\r\nbeen altogether creditable. He represented the elder branch of that\r\nNorman family, to the younger branch of which belonged the unfortunate\r\nhusband of Lady Jane Grey and the unscrupulous husband of Amy Robsart.\r\nThere was, however, very little likeness to Elizabeth\u0027s gay lover\r\nin grim Thomas Dudley. His Puritanism was bleak and stern, and for\r\nChristian charity he was not eminent. He had a foible for making verses,\r\nand at his death there was found in his pocket a poem of his, containing\r\na quatrain wherein the intolerance of that age is neatly summed up:--\r\n\r\n\"Let men of God in courts and churches watch O\u0027er such as do a\r\nToleration hatch, Lest that ill egg bring forth a cockatrice To poison\r\nall with heresy and vice.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the spirit of most of the Puritans of that day, but in the\r\nmanifestation of it there were great differences, and here was the\r\nstrong contrast between Dudley and Winthrop,--a contrast which shows\r\nitself in their portraits. In that of Dudley we see the typical\r\nnarrow-minded, strait-laced Calvinist for whom it is so much easier to\r\nentertain respect than affection. In that of Winthrop we see a face\r\nexpressive of what was finest in the age of Elizabeth,--the face of a\r\nspiritual brother of Raleigh and Bacon.\r\n\r\nThe accession of two men so important as Winthrop and Dudley served to\r\nbring matters speedily to a crisis. Their embarkation in April, 1630,\r\nwas the signal for a general movement on the part of the English\r\nPuritans. Before Christmas of that year seventeen ships had come to\r\nNew England, bringing more than 1000 passengers. This huge wave of\r\nimmigration quite overwhelmed and bore away the few links of possession\r\nby which Gorges had thus far kept his hold upon the country. In January,\r\n1629, John Gorges had tried to assert the validity of his late brother\u0027s\r\nclaim by executing conveyances covering portions of it. One of these\r\nwas to John Oldham, a man who had been harshly treated at Plymouth, and\r\nmight be supposed very ready to defend his rights against settlers\r\nof the Puritan company. Gorges further maintained that he retained\r\npossession of the country through the presence of his brother\u0027s tenants,\r\nBlackstone, Maverick, Walford, and others on the shores of the bay. In\r\nJune, 1629, Endicott had responded by sending forward some fifty persons\r\nfrom Salem to begin the settlement of Charlestown. Shortly before\r\nWinthrop\u0027s departure from England, Gorges had sent that singular\r\npersonage Sir Christopher Gardiner to look after his interests in the\r\nNew World, and there he was presently found established near the mouth\r\nof the Neponset river, in company with \"a comly yonge woman whom he\r\ncaled his cousin.\" But these few claimants were now at once lost in the\r\nhuman tide which poured over Charlestown, Boston, Newtown, Watertown,\r\nRoxbury, and Dorchester. The settlement at Merrymount was again\r\ndispersed, and Morton sent back to London; Gardiner fled to the coast\r\nof Maine and thence sailed for England in 1632. The Puritans had indeed\r\noccupied the country in force.\r\n\r\nHere on the very threshold we are confronted by facts which show that\r\nnot a mere colonial plantation, but a definite and organized state was\r\nin process of formation. The emigration was not like that of Jamestown\r\nor of Plymouth. It sufficed at once to make the beginnings of half a\r\ndozen towns, and the question as to self-government immediately sprang\r\nup. Early in 1631 a tax of £60 was assessed upon the settlements, in\r\norder to pay for building frontier fortifications at Newtown. This\r\nincident was in itself of small dimensions, as incidents in newly\r\nfounded states are apt to be. But in its historic import it may serve\r\nto connect the England of John Hampden with the New England of Samuel\r\nAdams. The inhabitants of Watertown at first declined to pay this tax,\r\nwhich was assessed by the Board of Assistants, on the ground that\r\nEnglish freemen cannot rightfully be taxed save by their own consent.\r\nThis protest led to a change in the constitution of the infant colony,\r\nand here, at once, we are introduced to the beginnings of American\r\nconstitutional history. At first it was thought that public business\r\ncould be transacted by a primary assembly of all the freemen in the\r\ncolony meeting four times in the year; but the number of freemen\r\nincreased so fast that this was almost at once (in October, 1630) found\r\nto be impracticable. The right of choosing the governor and making the\r\nlaws was then left to the Board of Assistants; and in May, 1631, it was\r\nfurther decided that the assistants need not be chosen afresh every\r\nyear, but might keep their seats during good behaviour or until ousted\r\nby special vote of the freemen. If the settlers of Massachusetts had\r\nbeen ancient Greeks or Romans, this would have been about as far as they\r\ncould go in the matter; the choice would have been between a primary\r\nassembly and an assembly of notables. It is curious to see Englishmen\r\npassing from one of these alternatives to the other. But it was only for\r\na moment. The protest of the Watertown men came in time to check these\r\nproceedings, which began to have a decidedly oligarchical look. To\r\nsettle the immediate question of the tax, two deputies were sent from\r\neach settlement to advise with the Board of Assistants; while the power\r\nof choosing each year the governor and assistants was resumed by the\r\nfreemen. Two years later, in order to reserve to the freemen the power\r\nof making laws without interfering too much with the ordinary business\r\nof life, the colonists fell back upon the old English rural plan of\r\nelecting deputies or representatives to a general court. [Sidenote: The\r\nquestion as to self-government raised at Watertown]\r\n\r\nAt first the deputies sat in the same chamber with the assistants, but\r\nat length in 1644 they were formed into a second chamber with increased\r\npowers, and the way in which this important constitutional change came\r\nabout is worth remembering, as an illustration of the smallness of the\r\nstate which so soon was to play a great part in history. As Winthrop\r\nputs it, \"there fell out a great business upon a very small occasion.\"\r\nTo a certain Captain Keayne, of Boston, a rich man deemed to be hard and\r\noverbearing toward the poor, there was brought a stray pig, whereof he\r\ngave due public notice through the town-crier, yet none came to claim it\r\ntill after he had killed a pig of his own which he kept in the same stye\r\nwith the stray. A year having passed by, a poor woman named Sherman came\r\nto see the stray and to decide if it were one that she had lost. Not\r\nrecognizing it as hers, she forthwith laid claim to the slaughtered pig.\r\nThe case was brought before the elders of the church of Boston, who\r\ndecided that the woman was mistaken. Mrs. Sherman then accused the\r\ncaptain of theft, and brought the case before a jury, which exonerated\r\nthe defendant with £3 costs. The captain then sued Mrs. Sherman for\r\ndefamation of character and got a verdict for £40 damages, a round\r\nsum indeed to assess upon the poor woman. But long before this it had\r\nappeared that she had many partisans and supporters; it had become a\r\npolitical question, in which the popular protest against aristocracy was\r\nimplicated. Not yet browbeaten, the warlike Mrs. Sherman appealed to the\r\nGeneral Court. The length of the hearing shows the importance which\r\nwas attached to the case. After seven days of discussion, the vote\r\nwas taken. Seven assistants and eight deputies approved the former\r\ndecisions, two assistants and fifteen deputies condemned them, while\r\nseven deputies refrained from voting. In other words, Captain Keayne has\r\na decided majority among the more aristocratic assistants, while Mrs.\r\nSherman seemed to prevail with the more democratic deputies. Regarding\r\nthe result as the vote of a single body, the woman had a plurality of\r\ntwo; regarding it as the vote of a double body, her cause had prevailed\r\nin the lower house, but was lost by the veto of the upper. No decision\r\nwas reached at the time, but after a year of discussion the legislature\r\nwas permanently separated into two houses, each with a veto power upon\r\nthe other; and this was felt to be a victory for the assistants. As for\r\nthe ecclesiastical polity of the new colony, it had begun to take\r\nshape immediately upon the arrival of Endicott\u0027s party at Salem. The\r\nclergymen, Samuel Skelton and Francis Higginson, consecrated each\r\nother, and a church covenant and confession of faith were drawn up by\r\nHigginson. Thirty persons joining in this covenant constituted the first\r\nchurch in the colony; and several brethren appointed by this church\r\nproceeded formally to ordain the two ministers by the laying on of\r\nhands. In such simple wise was the first Congregational church in\r\nMassachusetts founded. The simple fact of removal from England converted\r\nall the Puritan emigrants into Separatists, as Robinson had already\r\npredicted. Some, however, were not yet quite prepared for so radical a\r\nmeasure. These proceedings gave umbrage to two of the Salem party, who\r\nattempted forthwith to set up a separate church in conformity with\r\nepiscopal models. A very important question was thus raised at once, but\r\nit was not allowed to disturb the peace of the colony. Endicott was a\r\nman of summary methods. He immediately sent the two malcontents back to\r\nEngland; and thus the colonial church not only seceded from the national\r\nestablishment, but the principle was virtually laid down that the\r\nEpiscopal form of worship would not be tolerated in the colony. For the\r\npresent such a step was to be regarded as a measure of self-defence on\r\nthe part of the colonists. Episcopacy to them meant actual and practical\r\ntyranny--the very thing they had crossed the ocean expressly to get\r\naway from--and it was hardly to be supposed that they would encourage\r\nthe growth of it in their new home. One or two surpliced priests,\r\nconducting worship in accordance with the Book of Common Prayer, might\r\nin themselves be excellent members of society; but behind the surpliced\r\npriest the colonist saw the intolerance of Laud and the despotism of\r\nthe Court of High Commission. In 1631 a still more searching measure\r\nof self-protection was adopted. It was decided that \"no man shall be\r\nadmitted to the freedom of this body politic, but such as are members of\r\nsome of the churches within the limits of the same.\" Into the merits of\r\nthis measure as illustrating the theocratic ideal of society which the\r\nPuritans sought to realize in New England, we shall inquire hereafter.\r\nAt present we must note that, as a measure of self-protection, this\r\ndecree was intended to keep out of the new community all emissaries of\r\nStrafford and Laud, as well as such persons as Morton and Gardiner and\r\nother agents of Sir Ferdinando Gorges.\r\n\r\nBy the year 1634 the scheme of the Massachusetts Company had so far\r\nprospered that nearly 4000 Englishmen had come over, and some twenty\r\nvillages on or near the shores of the bay had been founded. The building\r\nof permanent houses, roads, fences, and bridges had begun to go on quite\r\nbriskly; farms were beginning to yield a return for the labour of the\r\nhusbandman; lumber, furs, and salted fish were beginning to be sent to\r\nEngland in exchange for manufactured articles; 4000 goats and 1500 head\r\nof cattle grazed in the pastures, and swine innumerable rooted in the\r\nclearings and helped to make ready the land for the ploughman. Political\r\nmeetings were held, justice was administered by magistrates after old\r\nEnglish precedents, and church services were performed by a score of\r\nclergymen, nearly all graduates of Cambridge, though one or two had\r\ntheir degrees from Oxford, and nearly all of whom had held livings in\r\nthe Church of England. The most distinguished of these clergymen, John\r\nCotton, in his younger days a Fellow and Tutor of Emmanuel College, had\r\nfor more than twenty years been rector of St. Botolph\u0027s, when he left\r\nthe most magnificent parish church in England to hold service in the\r\nfirst rude meeting-house of the new Boston. From Emmanuel College came\r\nalso Thomas Hooker and John Harvard. Besides these clergymen, so many of\r\nthe leading persons concerned in the emigration were university men that\r\nit was not long before a university began to seem indispensable to\r\nthe colony. In 1636 the General Court appropriated £400 toward the\r\nestablishment of a college at Newtown. In 1638 John Harvard, dying\r\nchildless, bequeathed his library and the half of his estate to the new\r\ncollege, which the Court forthwith ordered to be called by his name;\r\nwhile in honour of the mother university the name of the town was\r\nchanged to Cambridge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Founding of Harvard College]\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the assembly which decreed the establishment\r\nof Harvard College was \"the first body in which the people, by their\r\nrepresentatives, ever gave their own money to found a place of\r\neducation.\" [8] The act was a memorable one if we have regard to all the\r\ncircumstances of the year in which it was done. On every side danger was\r\nin the air. Threatened at once with an Indian war, with the enmity of\r\nthe home government, and with grave dissensions among themselves, the\r\nyear 1636 was a trying one indeed for the little community of Puritans,\r\nand their founding a college by public taxation just at this time is a\r\nstriking illustration of their unalterable purpose to realize, in this\r\nnew home, their ideal of an educated Christian society. [Sidenote:\r\nThreefold danger in the year 1636]\r\n\r\nThat the government of Charles I. should view with a hostile eye the\r\ngrowth of a Puritan state in New England is not at all surprising. (1.\r\nFrom the king, who prepares to attack the infant colony but is fueled by\r\ndissensions at home.) The only fit ground for wonder would seem to be\r\nthat Charles should have been willing at the outset to grant a charter\r\nto the able and influential Puritans who organized the Company of\r\nMassachusetts Bay. Probably, however, the king thought at first that it\r\nwould relieve him at home if a few dozen of the Puritan leaders could\r\nbe allowed to concentrate their minds upon a project of colonization in\r\nAmerica. It might divert attention for a moment from his own despotic\r\nschemes. Very likely the scheme would prove a failure and the\r\nMassachusetts colony incur a fate like that of Roanoke Island; and at\r\nall events the wealth of the Puritans might better be sunk in a remote\r\nand perilous enterprise than employed at home in organizing resistance\r\nto the crown. Such, very likely, may have been the king\u0027s motive in\r\ngranting the Massachusetts charter two days after turning his Parliament\r\nout of doors. But the events of the last half-dozen years had come to\r\npresent the case in a new light. The young colony was not languishing.\r\nIt was full of sturdy life; it had wrought mischief to the schemes of\r\nGorges; and what was more, it had begun to take unheard-of liberties\r\nwith things ecclesiastical and political. Its example was getting to be\r\na dangerous one. It was evidently worth while to put a strong curb upon\r\nMassachusetts. Any promise made to his subjects Charles regarded as\r\na promise made under duress which he was quite justified in breaking\r\nwhenever it suited his purpose to do so. Enemies of Massachusetts were\r\nbusy in England. Schismatics from Salem and revellers from Merrymount\r\nwere ready with their tales of woe, and now Gorges and Mason were\r\nvigorously pressing their territorial claims. They bargained with\r\nthe king. In February, 1635, the moribund Council for New England\r\nsurrendered its charter and all its corporate rights in America, on\r\ncondition that the king should disregard all the various grants by which\r\nthese rights had from time to time been alienated, and should divide\r\nup the territory of New England in severalty among the members of the\r\nCouncil. In pursuance of this scheme Gorges and Mason, together with\r\nhalf a dozen noblemen, were allowed to parcel out New England among\r\nthemselves as they should see fit. In this way the influence of the\r\nMarquis of Hamilton, with the Earls of Arundel, Surrey, Carlisle, and\r\nStirling, might be actively enlisted against the Massachusetts Company.\r\nA writ of _quo warranto_ was brought against it; and it was proposed to\r\nsend Sir Ferdinando to govern New England with viceregal powers like\r\nthose afterward exercised by Andros.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the danger seemed alarming; but, as Winthrop says, \"the\r\nLord frustrated their design.\" It was noted as a special providence that\r\nthe ship in which Gorges was to sail was hardly off the stocks when it\r\nfell to pieces. Then the most indefatigable enemy of the colony, John\r\nMason, suddenly died. The king issued his famous writ of ship-money and\r\nset all England by the ears; and, to crown all, the attempt to read the\r\nEpiscopal liturgy at St. Giles\u0027s church in Edinburgh led straight to\r\nthe Solemn League and Covenant. Amid the first mutterings of the Great\r\nRebellion the proceedings against Massachusetts were dropped, and the\r\nunheeded colony went on thriving in its independent course. Possibly too\r\nsome locks at Whitehall may have been turned with golden keys, [9] for\r\nthe company was rich, and the king was ever open to such arguments. But\r\nwhen the news of his evil designs had first reached Boston the people of\r\nthe infant colony showed no readiness to yield to intimidation. In their\r\nmeasures there was a decided smack of what was to be realized a hundred\r\nand forty years later. Orders were immediately issued for fortifying\r\nCastle Island in the harbour and the heights at Charlestown and\r\nDorchester. Militia companies were put in training, and a beacon was\r\nset up on the highest hill in Boston, to give prompt notice to all the\r\nsurrounding country of any approaching enemy.\r\n\r\nWhile the ill will of the home government thus kept the colonists in a\r\nstate of alarm, there were causes of strife at work at their very doors,\r\nof which they were fain to rid themselves as soon as possible. Among all\r\nthe Puritans who came to New England there is no more interesting figure\r\nthan the learned, quick-witted pugnacious Welshman, Roger Williams. He\r\nwas over-fond of logical subtleties and delighted in controversy. There\r\nwas scarcely any subject about which he did not wrangle, from the\r\nsinfulness of persecution to the propriety of women wearing veils in\r\nchurch. Yet, with all this love of controversy, there has perhaps\r\nnever lived a more gentle and kindly soul. Within five years from the\r\nsettlement of Massachusetts this young preacher had announced the true\r\nprinciples of religious liberty with a clearness of insight quite\r\nremarkable in that age. Roger Williams had been aided in securing an\r\neducation by the great lawyer Sir Edward Coke, and had lately taken his\r\ndegree at Pembroke College, Cambridge; but the boldness with which he\r\ndeclared his opinions had aroused the hostility of Laud, and in 1631 he\r\nhad come over to Plymouth, whence he removed two years later to Salem,\r\nand became pastor of the church there. The views of Williams, if\r\nlogically carried out, involved the entire separation of church from\r\nstate, the equal protection of all forms of religious faith, the repeal\r\nof all laws compelling attendance on public worship, the abolition of\r\ntithes and of all forced contributions to the support of religion. Such\r\nviews are to-day quite generally adopted by the more civilized portions\r\nof the Protestant world; but it is needless to say that they were not\r\nthe views of the seventeenth century, in Massachusetts or elsewhere. For\r\ndeclaring such opinions as these on the continent of Europe, anywhere\r\nexcept in Holland, a man like Williams would in that age have run great\r\nrisk of being burned at the stake. In England, under the energetic\r\nmisgovernment of Laud, he would very likely have had to stand in the\r\npillory with his ears cropped, or perhaps, like Bunyan and Baxter, would\r\nhave been sent to jail. In Massachusetts such views were naturally\r\nenough regarded as anarchical, but in Williams\u0027s case they were further\r\ncomplicated by grave political imprudence. He wrote a pamphlet in which\r\nhe denied the right of the colonists to the lands which they held in New\r\nEngland under the king\u0027s grant. He held that the soil belonged to the\r\nIndians, that the settlers could only obtain a valid title to it by\r\npurchase from them, and that the acceptance of a patent from a mere\r\nintruder, like the king, was a sin requiring public repentance. This\r\ndoctrine was sure to be regarded in England as an attack upon the king\u0027s\r\nsupremacy over Massachusetts, and at the same time an incident occurred\r\nin Salem which made it all the more unfortunate. The royal colours under\r\nwhich the little companies of militia marched were emblazoned with the\r\nred cross of St. George. The uncompromising Endicott loathed this emblem\r\nas tainted with Popery, and one day he publicly defaced the flag of the\r\nSalem company by cutting out the cross. The enemies of Massachusetts\r\nmisinterpreted this act as a defiance aimed at the royal authority, and\r\nthey attributed it to the teachings of Williams. In view of the king\u0027s\r\nunfriendliness these were dangerous proceedings. Endicott was summoned\r\nbefore the General Court at Boston, where he was publicly reprimanded\r\nand declared incapable of holding office for a year. A few months\r\nafterward, in January, 1636, Williams was ordered by the General Court\r\nto come to Boston and embark in a ship that was about to set sail for\r\nEngland. But he escaped into the forest, and made his way through the\r\nsnow to the wigwam of Massasoit. He was a rare linguist, and had learned\r\nto talk fluently in the language of the Indians, and now he passed the\r\nwinter in trying to instill into their ferocious hearts something of the\r\ngentleness of Christianity. In the spring he was privately notified by\r\nWinthrop that if he were to steer his course to Narragansett bay he\r\nwould be secure from molestation; and such was the beginning of the\r\nsettlement of Providence. [Sidenote: From religious dissensions; Roger\r\nWilliams]\r\n\r\nShortly before the departure of Williams, there came to Boston one of\r\nthe greatest Puritan statesmen of that heroic age, the younger Henry\r\nVane. It is pleasant to remember that the man and Anne who did so much\r\nto overthrow the tyranny of Strafford, who brought the military strength\r\nof Scotland to the aid of the hard-pressed Parliament, who administered\r\nthe navy with which Blake won his astonishing victories, who dared even\r\nwithstand Cromwell at the height of his power when his measures became\r\ntoo violent,--it is pleasant to remember that this admirable man was\r\nonce the chief magistrate of an American commonwealth. It is pleasant\r\nfor a Harvard man to remember that as such he presided over the assembly\r\nthat founded our first university. Thorough republican and enthusiastic\r\nlover of liberty, he was spiritually akin to Jefferson and to Samuel\r\nAdams. Like Williams he was a friend to toleration, and like Williams\r\nhe found Massachusetts an uncomfortable home. In 1636 he was only\r\ntwenty-four years of age, \"young in years,\" and perhaps not yet \"in\r\nsage counsel old.\" He was chosen governor for that year, and his\r\nadministration was stormy. Among those persons who had followed Mr.\r\nCotton from Lincolnshire was Mrs. Anne Hutchinson, a very bright and\r\ncapable lady, if perhaps somewhat impulsive and indiscreet. She had\r\nbrought over with her, says Winthrop, \"two dangerous errors: first, that\r\nthe person of the Holy Ghost dwells in a justified person; second, that\r\nno sanctification can help to evidence to us our justification.\" Into\r\nthe merits of such abstruse doctrines it is not necessary for the\r\nhistorian to enter. One can hardly repress a smile as one reflects\r\nhow early in the history of Boston some of its characteristic social\r\nfeatures were developed. It is curious to read of lectures there in\r\n1636, lectures by a lady, and transcendentalist lectures withal! Never\r\ndid lectures in Boston arouse greater excitement than Mrs. Hutchinson\u0027s.\r\nMany of her hearers forsook the teachings of the regular ministers, to\r\nfollow her. [Sidenote: Henry Vane and Anne Hutchinson]\r\n\r\nShe was very effectively supported by her brother-in-law, Mr.\r\nWheelwright, an eloquent preacher, and for a while she seemed to be\r\ncarrying everything before her. She won her old minister Mr. Cotton, she\r\nwon the stout soldier Captain Underhill, she won Governor Vane himself;\r\nwhile she incurred the deadly hatred of such men as Dudley and Cotton\u0027s\r\nassociate John Wilson. The church at Boston was divided into two hostile\r\ncamps. The sensible Winthrop marvelled at hearing men distinguished \"by\r\nbeing under a covenant of grace or a covenant of works, as in other\r\ncountries between Protestants and Papists,\" and he ventured to doubt\r\nwhether any man could really tell what the difference was. The\r\ntheological strife went on until it threatened to breed civil\r\ndisaffection among the followers of Mrs. Hutchinson. A peculiar\r\nbitterness was given to the affair, from the fact that she professed to\r\nbe endowed with the spirit of prophecy and taught her partisans that it\r\nwas their duty to follow the biddings of a supernatural light; and there\r\nwas nothing which the orthodox Puritan so steadfastly abhorred as the\r\nanarchical pretence of living by the aid of a supernatural light. In a\r\nstrong and complex society the teachings of Mrs. Hutchinson would have\r\nawakened but a languid speculative interest, or perhaps would have\r\npassed by unheeded. In the simple society of Massachusetts in 1636,\r\nphysically weak and as yet struggling for very existence, the practical\r\neffect of such teachings may well have been deemed politically\r\ndangerous. When things came to such a pass that the forces of the colony\r\nwere mustered for an Indian campaign and the men of Boston were ready to\r\nshirk the service because they suspected their chaplain to be \"under a\r\ncovenant of works,\" it was naturally thought to be high time to put Mrs.\r\nHutchinson down. In the spring of 1637 Winthrop was elected governor,\r\nand in August Vane returned to England. His father had at that moment\r\nmore influence with the king than any other person except Strafford,\r\nand the young man had indiscreetly hinted at an appeal to the home\r\ngovernment for the protection of the Antinomians, as Mrs. Hutchinson\u0027s\r\nfollowers were called. But an appeal from America to England was\r\nsomething which Massachusetts would no more tolerate in the days of\r\nWinthrop than in the days of Hancock and Adams. Soon after Vane\u0027s\r\ndeparture, Mrs. Hutchinson and her friends were ordered to leave the\r\ncolony. It was doubtless an odious act of persecution, yet of all\r\nsuch acts which stain the history of Massachusetts in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, it is just the one for which the plea of political necessity\r\nmay really be to some extent accepted.\r\n\r\nWe now begin to see how the spreading of the New England colonization,\r\nand the founding of distinct communities, was hastened by these\r\ndifferences of opinion on theological questions or on questions\r\nconcerning the relations between church and state. Of Mrs. Hutchinson\u0027s\r\nfriends and adherents, some went northward, and founded the towns of\r\nExeter and Hampton. Some time before Portsmouth and Dover had been\r\nsettled by followers of Mason and Gorges. In 1641 these towns were added\r\nto the domain of Massachusetts, and so the matter stood until 1679, when\r\nwe shall see Charles II. marking them off as a separate province, under\r\na royal government. Such were the beginnings of New Hampshire. Mrs.\r\nHutchinson herself, however, with the rest of her adherents, bought\r\nthe island of Aquedneck from the Indians, and settlements were made at\r\nPortsmouth and Newport. After a quarter of a century of turbulence,\r\nthese settlements coalesced with Williams\u0027s colony at Providence, and\r\nthus was formed the state of Rhode Island. After her husband\u0027s death in\r\n1642, Mrs. Hutchinson left Aquedneck and settled upon some land to the\r\nwest of Stamford and supposed to be within the territory of the New\r\nNetherlands. There in the following year she was cruelly murdered by\r\nIndians, together with nearly all her children and servants, sixteen\r\nvictims in all. One of her descendants was the illustrious Thomas\r\nHutchinson, the first great American historian, and last royal governor\r\nof Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nTo the dangers arising from the ill-will of the crown, and from these\r\ntheological quarrels, there was added the danger of a general attack by\r\nthe savages. Down to this time, since the landing of the Pilgrims at\r\nPlymouth, the settlers of New England had been in no way molested by the\r\nnatives. Massasoit\u0027s treaty with the Pilgrims was scrupulously observed\r\non both sides, and kept the Wampanoags quiet for fifty-four years. The\r\nsomewhat smaller tribe which took its name from the _Massawachusett_, or\r\nGreat Hill, of Milton, kept on friendly terms with the settlers about\r\nBoston, because these red men coveted the powerful aid of the white\r\nstrangers in case of war with their hereditary foes the Tarratines, who\r\ndwelt in the Piscataqua country. It was only when the English began\r\nto leave these coast regions and press into the interior that trouble\r\narose. The western shores of Narragansett bay were possessed by\r\nthe numerous and warlike tribe of that name, which held in partial\r\nsubjection the Nyantics near Point Judith. To the west of these, and\r\nabout the Thames river, dwelt the still more formidable Pequots, a tribe\r\nwhich for bravery and ferocity asserted a preeminence in New England\r\nnot unlike that which the Iroquois league of the Mohawk valley was fast\r\nwinning over all North America east of the Mississippi. North of the\r\nPequots, the squalid villages of the Nipmucks were scattered over the\r\nbeautiful highlands that stretch in long ridges from Quinsigamond to\r\nNichewaug, and beyond toward blue Monadnock. Westward, in the lower\r\nConnecticut valley, lived the Mohegans, a small but valiant tribe, now\r\nfor some time held tributary to their Pequot cousins, and very restive\r\nunder the yoke. The thickly wooded mountain ranges between the\r\nConnecticut and the Hudson had few human inhabitants. These hundred\r\nmiles of crag and forest were a bulwark none too wide or strong against\r\nthe incursions of the terrible Mohawks, whose name sent a shiver of fear\r\nthroughout savage New England, and whose forbearance the Nipmucks and\r\nMohegans were fain to ensure by a yearly payment of blackmail. Each\r\nsummer there came two Mohawk elders, secure in the dread that Iroquois\r\nprowess had everywhere inspired; and up and down the Connecticut valley\r\nthey seized the tribute of weapons and wampum, and proclaimed the last\r\nharsh edict issued from the savage council at Onondaga. The scowls that\r\ngreeted their unwelcome visits were doubtless nowhere fiercer than among\r\nthe Mohegans, thus ground down between Mohawk and Pequot as between the\r\nupper and the nether millstone. [Sidenote: From the Indians: the Pequot\r\nsupremacy]\r\n\r\nAmong the various points in which civilized man surpasses the savage\r\nnone is more conspicuous than the military brute force which in the\r\nhighest civilization is always latent though comparatively seldom\r\nexerted. The sudden intrusion of English warfare into the Indian world\r\nof the seventeenth century may well have seemed to the red men a\r\nsupernatural visitation, like the hurricane or the earthquake. The\r\nuncompromising vigour with which the founders of Massachusetts carried\r\non their work was viewed in some quarters with a dissatisfaction which\r\nsoon thrust the English migration into the very heart of the Indian\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe first movement, however, was directed against the encroachments of\r\nthe New Netherlands. In October, 1634, some men of Plymouth, led by\r\nWilliam Holmes, sailed up the Connecticut river, and, after bandying\r\nthreats with a party of Dutch who had built a rude fort on the site of\r\nHartford, passed on and fortified themselves on the site of Windsor.\r\nNext year Governor Van Twiller sent a company of seventy men to drive\r\naway these intruders, but after reconnoitring the situation the Dutchmen\r\nthought it best not to make an attack. Their little stronghold at\r\nHartford remained unmolested by the English, and, in order to secure\r\nthe communication between this advanced outpost and New Amsterdam, Van\r\nTwiller decided to build another fort at the mouth of the river, but\r\nthis time the English were beforehand. Rumours of Dutch designs may\r\nhave reached the ears of Lord Say and Sele and Lord Brooke--\"fanatic\r\nBrooke,\" as Scott calls him in \"Marmion\"--who had obtained from the\r\nCouncil for New England a grant of territory on the shores of the Sound.\r\nThese noblemen chose as their agent the younger John Winthrop, son of\r\nthe Massachusetts governor, and this new-comer arrived upon the scene\r\njust in time to drive away Van Twiller\u0027s vessel and build an English\r\nfort which in honour of his two patrons he called \"Say-Brooke.\"\r\n\r\nHad it not been for seeds of discontent already sown in Massachusetts,\r\nthe English hold upon the Connecticut valley might perhaps have been\r\nfor a few years confined to these two military outposts at Windsor and\r\nSaybrook. But there were people in Massachusetts who did not look with\r\nfavour upon the aristocratic and theocratic features in its polity. The\r\nprovision that none but church-members should vote or hold office was\r\nby no means unanimously approved. We see it in the course of another\r\ngeneration putting altogether too much temporal power into the hands of\r\nthe clergy, and we can trace the growth of the opposition to it until in\r\nthe reign of Charles II. it becomes a dangerous source of weakness to\r\nMassachusetts. At the outset the opposition seems to have been strongest\r\nin Dorchester, Newtown, and Watertown. When the Board of Assistants\r\nundertook to secure for themselves permanency of tenure, together with\r\nthe power of choosing the governor and making the laws, these three\r\ntowns sent deputies to Boston to inspect the charter and see if it\r\nauthorized any such stretch of power. They were foremost in insisting\r\nthat representatives chosen by the towns must have a share in the\r\ngeneral government. Men who held such opinions were naturally unwilling\r\nto increase the political weight of the clergy, who, during these early\r\ndisputes and indeed until the downfall of the charter, were inclined to\r\ntake aristocratic views and to sympathize with the Board of Assistants.\r\nCotton declared that democracy was no fit government either for church\r\nor for commonwealth, and the majority of the ministers agreed with\r\nhim. Chief among those who did not was the learned and eloquent Thomas\r\nHooker, pastor of the church at Newtown. When Winthrop, in a letter to\r\nHooker, defended the restriction of the suffrage on the ground that \"the\r\nbest part is always the least, and of that best part the wiser part is\r\nalways the lesser;\" Hooker replied that \"in matters which concern the\r\ncommon good, a general council, chosen by all, to transact businesses\r\nwhich concern all, I conceive most suitable to rule and most safe for\r\nrelief of the whole.\" It is interesting to meet, on the very threshold\r\nof American history, with such a lucid statement of the strongly\r\ncontrasted views which a hundred and fifty years later were to be\r\nrepresented on a national scale by Hamilton and Jefferson. There were\r\nmany in Newtown who took Hooker\u0027s view of the matter; and there, as\r\nalso in Watertown and Dorchester, which in 1633 took the initiative in\r\nframing town governments with selectmen, a strong disposition was shown\r\nto evade the restrictions upon the suffrage.\r\n\r\nWhile such things were talked about in the summer of 1633 the\r\nadventurous John Oldham was making his way through the forest and over\r\nthe mountains into the Connecticut valley, and when he returned to\r\nthe coast his glowing accounts set some people to thinking. Two years\r\nafterward a few pioneers from Dorchester pushed through the wilderness\r\nas far as the Plymouth men\u0027s fort at Windsor, while a party from\r\nWatertown went farther and came to a halt upon the site of Wethersfield.\r\nA larger party, bringing cattle and such goods as they could carry,\r\nset out in the autumn and succeeded in reaching Windsor. Their winter\r\nsupplies were sent around by water to meet them, but early in November\r\nthe ships had barely passed the Saybrook fort when they found the river\r\nblocked with ice and were obliged to return to Boston. The sufferings of\r\nthe pioneers, thus cut off from the world, were dreadful. Their cattle\r\nperished, and they were reduced to a diet of acorns and ground-nuts.\r\nSome seventy of them, walking on the frozen river to Saybrook, were\r\nso fortunate as to find a crazy little sloop jammed in the ice. They\r\nsucceeded in cutting her adrift, and steered themselves back to Boston.\r\nOthers surmounted greater obstacles in struggling back through the snow\r\nover the region which the Pullman car now traverses, regardless of\r\nseasons, in three hours. A few grim heroes, the nameless founders of a\r\nnoble commonwealth, stayed on the spot and defied starvation. In the\r\nnext June, 1636, the Newtown congregation, a hundred or more in number,\r\nled by their sturdy pastor, and bringing with them 160 head of cattle,\r\nmade the pilgrimage to the Connecticut valley. Women and children took\r\npart in this pleasant summer journey; Mrs. Hooker, the pastor\u0027s wife,\r\nbeing too ill to walk, was carried on a litter. Thus, in the memorable\r\nyear in which our great university was born, did Cambridge become, in\r\nthe true Greek sense of a much-abused word, the _metropolis_ or \"mother\r\ntown\" of Hartford. The migration at once became strong in numbers.\r\nDuring the past twelvemonth a score of ships had brought from England\r\nto Massachusetts more than 3000 souls, and so great an accession made\r\nfurther movement easy. Hooker\u0027s pilgrims were soon followed by the\r\nDorchester and Watertown congregations, and by the next May 800 people\r\nwere living in Windsor, Hartford, and Wethersfield. As we read of these\r\nmovements, not of individuals, but of organic communities, united in\r\nallegiance to a church and its pastor, and fervid with the instinct\r\nof self-government, we seem to see Greek history renewed, but with\r\ncenturies of added political training. For one year a board of\r\ncommissioners from Massachusetts governed the new towns, but at the end\r\nof that time the towns chose representatives and held a General Court at\r\nHartford, and thus the separate existence of Connecticut was begun. As\r\nfor Springfield, which was settled about the same time by a party from\r\nRoxbury, it remained for some years doubtful to which state it belonged.\r\nAt the opening session of the General Court, May 31,1638, Mr. Hooker\r\npreached a sermon of wonderful power, in which he maintained that \"the\r\nfoundation of authority is laid in the free consent of the people,\"\r\n\"that the choice of public magistrates belongs unto the people by God\u0027s\r\nown allowance,\" and that \"they who have power to appoint officers and\r\nmagistrates have the right also to set the bounds and limitations of\r\nthe power and place unto which they call them.\" On the 14th of January,\r\n1639, all the freemen of the three towns assembled at Hartford and\r\nadopted a written constitution in which the hand of the great preacher\r\nis clearly discernible. It is worthy of note that this document contains\r\nnone of the conventional references to a \"dread sovereign\" or a\r\n\"gracious king,\" nor the slightest allusion to the British or any other\r\ngovernment outside of Connecticut itself, nor does it prescribe any\r\ncondition of church-membership for the right of suffrage. It was the\r\nfirst written constitution known to history, that created a government,\r\n[10] and it marked the beginnings of American democracy, of which Thomas\r\nHooker deserves more than any other man to be called the father. The\r\ngovernment of the United States today is in lineal descent more nearly\r\nrelated to that of Connecticut than to that of any of the other thirteen\r\ncolonies. The most noteworthy feature of the Connecticut republic was\r\nthat it was a federation of independent towns, and that all attributes\r\nof sovereignty not expressly granted to the General Court remained,\r\nas of original right, in the towns. Moreover, while the governor and\r\ncouncil were chosen by a majority vote of the whole people, and by a\r\nsuffrage that was almost universal, there was for each township an\r\nequality of representation in the assembly. [11] This little federal\r\nrepublic was allowed to develop peacefully and normally; its\r\nconstitution was not violently wrenched out of shape like that of\r\nMassachusetts at the end of the seventeenth century. It silently grew\r\ntill it became the strongest political structure on the continent, as\r\nwas illustrated in the remarkable military energy and the unshaken\r\nfinancial credit of Connecticut during the Revolutionary War; and in the\r\nchief crisis of the Federal Convention of 1787 Connecticut, with her\r\ncompromise which secured equal state representation in one branch of the\r\nnational government and popular representation in the other, played the\r\ncontrolling part. [Sidenote: Connecticut Pioneers] [Sidenote: The first\r\nwritten constitution]\r\n\r\nBefore the little federation of towns had framed its government, it had\r\nits Indian question to dispose of. Three years before the migration led\r\nby Hooker, a crew of eight traders, while making their way up the river\r\nto the Dutch station on the site of Hartford, had been murdered by a\r\nparty of Indians subject to Sassacus, chief sachem of the Pequots.\r\nNegotiations concerning this outrage had gone on between Sassacus and\r\nthe government at Boston, and the Pequots had promised to deliver up\r\nthe murderers, but had neglected to do so. In the summer of 1636 some\r\nIndians on Block Island subject to the Narragansetts murdered the\r\npioneer John Oldham, who was sailing on the Sound, and captured his\r\nlittle vessel. At this, says Underhill, \"God stirred up the hearts\" of\r\nGovernor Vane and the rest of the magistrates. They were determined to\r\nmake an end of the Indian question and show the savages that such things\r\nwould not be endured. First an embassy was sent to Canonicus and his\r\nnephew Miantonomo, chief sachems of the Narragansetts, who hastened\r\nto disclaim all responsibility for the murder, and to throw the blame\r\nentirely upon the Indians of the island. Vane then sent out three\r\nvessels under command of Endicott, who ravaged Block Island, burning\r\nwigwams, sinking canoes, and slaying dogs, for the men had taken to the\r\nwoods. Endicott then crossed to the mainland to reckon with the Pequots.\r\nHe demanded the surrender of the murderers, with a thousand fathoms of\r\nwampum for damages; and not getting a satisfactory answer, he attacked\r\nthe Indians, killed a score of them, seized their ripe corn, and burned\r\nand spoiled what he could. But such reprisals served only to enrage the\r\nred men. Lyon Gardiner, commander of the Saybrook fort, complained to\r\nEndicott: \"You come hither to raise these wasps about my ears; then\r\nyou will take wing and flee away.\" The immediate effect was to incite\r\nSassacus to do his utmost to compass the ruin of the English. The\r\nsuperstitious awe with which the white men were at first regarded had\r\nbeen somewhat lessened by familiar contact with them, as in Aesop\u0027s\r\nfable of the fox and the lion. The resources of Indian diplomacy were\r\nexhausted in the attempt to unite the Narragansett warriors with the\r\nPequots in a grand crusade against the white men. Such a combination\r\ncould hardly have been as formidable as that which was effected forty\r\nyears afterward in King Philip\u0027s war; for the savages had not as yet\r\nbecome accustomed to firearms, and the English settlements did not\r\npresent so many points exposed to attack; but there is no doubt that\r\nit might have wrought fearful havoc. We can, at any rate, find no\r\ndifficulty in comprehending the manifold perplexity of the Massachusetts\r\nmen at this time, threatened as they were at once by an Indian crusade,\r\nby the machinations of a faithless king, and by a bitter theological\r\nquarrel at home, in this eventful year when they laid aside part of\r\ntheir incomes to establish Harvard College. [Sidenote: Origin of the\r\nPequot War]\r\n\r\nThe schemes of Sassacus were unsuccessful. The hereditary enmity of the\r\nNarragansetts toward their Pequot rivals was too strong to be lightly\r\novercome. Roger Williams, taking advantage of this feeling, so worked\r\nupon the minds of the Narragansett chiefs that in the autumn of 1636\r\nthey sent an embassy to Boston and made a treaty of alliance with the\r\nEnglish. The Pequots were thus left to fight out their own quarrel; and\r\nhad they still been separated from the English by the distance between\r\nBoston and the Thames river, the feud might very likely have smouldered\r\nuntil the drift of events had given a different shape to it. But as the\r\nEnglish had in this very year thrown out their advanced posts into the\r\nlower Connecticut valley, there was clearly no issue from the situation\r\nsave in deadly war. All through the winter of 1636-37 the Connecticut\r\ntowns were kept in a state of alarm by the savages. Men going to their\r\nwork were killed and horribly mangled. A Wethersfield man was kidnapped\r\nand roasted alive. Emboldened by the success of this feat, the Pequots\r\nattacked Wethersfield, massacred ten people, and carried away two girls.\r\n[Sidenote: Sassacus is foiled by Roger Williams] [Sidenote: The Pequots\r\ntake the warpath alone]\r\n\r\nWrought up to desperation by these atrocities, the Connecticut men\r\nappealed to Massachusetts and Plymouth for aid, and put into service\r\nninety of their own number, under command of John Mason, an excellent\r\nand sturdy officer who had won golden opinions from Sir Thomas Fairfax,\r\nunder whom he had served in the Netherlands. It took time to get men\r\nfrom Boston, and all that Massachusetts contributed to the enterprise at\r\nits beginning was that eccentric daredevil John Underhill, with a force\r\nof twenty men. Seventy friendly Mohegans, under their chief Uncas, eager\r\nto see vengeance wrought upon their Pequot oppressors, accompanied the\r\nexpedition. From the fort at Saybrook this little company set sail on\r\nthe twentieth of May, 1637, and landed in brilliant moonlight near Point\r\nJudith, where they were reinforced by four hundred Narragansetts and\r\nNyantics. From this point they turned westward toward the stronghold of\r\nthe Pequots, near the place where the town of Stonington now stands. As\r\nthey approached the dreaded spot the courage of the Indian allies gave\r\nout, and they slunk behind, declaring that Sassacus was a god whom\r\nit was useless to think of attacking. The force with which Mason\r\nand Underhill advanced to the fray consisted of just seventy-seven\r\nEnglishmen. Their task was to assault and carry an entrenched fort or\r\nwalled village containing seven hundred Pequots. The fort was a\r\ncircle of two or three acres in area, girdled by a palisade of\r\nsturdy sapling-trunks, set firm and deep into the ground, the narrow\r\ninterstices between them serving as loopholes wherefrom to reconnoitre\r\nany one passing by and to shoot at assailants. At opposite sides of\r\nthis stronghold were two openings barely large enough to let any one go\r\nthrough. Within this enclosure were the crowded wigwams. The attack was\r\nskilfully managed, and was a complete surprise. A little before daybreak\r\nMason, with sixteen men, occupied one of the doors, while Underhill made\r\nsure of the other. The Indians in panic sought first one outlet and then\r\nthe other, and were ruthlessly shot down, whichever way they turned. A\r\nfew succeeded in breaking loose, but these were caught and tomahawked by\r\nthe Indian allies, who, though afraid to take the risks of the fight,\r\nwere ready enough to help slay the fugitives. The English threw\r\nfirebrands among the wigwams, and soon the whole village was in a light\r\nblaze, and most of the savages suffered the horrible death which they\r\nwere so fond of inflicting upon their captives. Of the seven hundred\r\nPequots in the stronghold, but five got away with their lives. All this\r\nbloody work had been done in less than an hour, and of the English there\r\nhad been two killed and sixteen wounded. It was the end of the Pequot\r\nnation. Of the remnant which had not been included in this wholesale\r\nslaughter, most were soon afterwards destroyed piecemeal in a running\r\nfight which extended as far westward as the site of Fairfield. Sassacus\r\nfled across the Hudson river to the Mohawks, who slew him and sent his\r\nscalp to Boston, as a peace-offering to the English. The few survivors\r\nwere divided between the Mohegans and Narragansetts and adopted into\r\nthose tribes. Truly the work was done with Cromwellian thoroughness. The\r\ntribe which had lorded it so fiercely over the New England forests was\r\nall at once wiped out of existence. So terrible a vengeance the Indians\r\nhad never heard of. If the name of Pequot had hitherto been a name of\r\nterror, so now did the Englishmen win the inheritance of that deadly\r\nprestige. Not for eight-and-thirty years after the destruction of the\r\nPequots, not until a generation of red men had grown up that knew not\r\nUnderhill and Mason, did the Indian of New England dare again to lift\r\nhis hand against the white man. [Sidenote: And are exterminated]\r\n\r\nSuch scenes of wholesale slaughter are not pleasant reading in this\r\nmilder age. But our forefathers felt that the wars of Canaan afforded\r\na sound precedent for such cases; and, indeed, if we remember what\r\nthe soldiers of Tilly and Wallenstein were doing at this very time in\r\nGermany, we shall realize that the work of Mason and Underhill would not\r\nhave been felt by any one in that age to merit censure or stand in need\r\nof excuses. As a matter of practical policy the annihilation of the\r\nPequots can be condemned only by those who read history so incorrectly\r\nas to suppose that savages, whose business is to torture and slay, can\r\nalways be dealt with according to the methods in use between civilized\r\npeoples. A mighty nation, like the United States, is in honour bound to\r\ntreat the red man with scrupulous justice and refrain from cruelty in\r\npunishing his delinquencies. But if the founders of Connecticut, in\r\nconfronting a danger which threatened their very existence, struck with\r\nsavage fierceness, we cannot blame them. The world is so made that it\r\nis only in that way that the higher races have been able to preserve\r\nthemselves and carry on their progressive work.\r\n\r\nThe overthrow of the Pequots was a cardinal event in the planting of\r\nNew England. It removed the chief obstacle to the colonization of\r\nthe Connecticut coast, and brought the inland settlements into such\r\nunimpeded communication with those on tide-water as to prepare the way\r\nfor the formation of the New England confederacy. Its first fruits were\r\nseen in the direction taken by the next wave of migration, which ended\r\nthe Puritan exodus from England to America. About a month after the\r\nstorming of the palisaded village there arrived in Boston a company of\r\nwealthy London merchants, with their families. The most prominent among\r\nthem, Theophilus Eaton, was a member of the Company of Massachusetts\r\nBay. Their pastor, John Davenport, was an eloquent preacher and a man of\r\npower. He was a graduate of Oxford, and in 1624 had been chosen vicar\r\nof St. Stephen\u0027s parish, in Coleman street, London. When he heard that\r\nCotton and Hooker were about to sail for America, he sought earnestly to\r\nturn them from what he deemed the error of their ways, but instead he\r\nbecame converted himself and soon incurred the especial enmity of Laud,\r\nso that it became necessary for him to flee to Amsterdam. In 1636 he\r\nreturned to England, and in concert with Eaton organized a scheme of\r\nemigration that included men from Yorkshire, Hertfordshire, and Kent.\r\nThe leaders arrived in Boston in the midst of the Antinomian disputes,\r\nand although Davenport won admiration for his skill in battling with\r\nheresy, he may perhaps have deemed it preferable to lead his flock\r\nto some new spot in the wilderness where such warfare might not be\r\nrequired. The merchants desired a fine harbour and good commercial\r\nsituation, and the reports of the men who returned from hunting the\r\nPequots told them of just such a spot at Quinnipiack on Long Island\r\nSound. Here they could carry out their plan of putting into practice\r\na theocratic ideal even more rigid than that which obtained in\r\nMassachusetts, and arrange their civil as well as ecclesiastical affairs\r\nin accordance with rules to be obtained from a minute study of the\r\nScriptures. [Sidenote: The colony of New Haven]\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1638 the town of New Haven was accordingly founded.\r\nThe next year a swarm from this new town settled Milford, while another\r\nparty, freshly arrived from England, made the beginnings of Guilford. In\r\n1640 Stamford was added to the group, and in 1643 the four towns were\r\nunited into the republic of New Haven, to which Southold, on Long\r\nIsland, and Branford were afterwards added. As being a confederation of\r\nindependent towns, New Haven resembled Connecticut. In other respects\r\nthe differences between the two reflected the differences between\r\nDavenport and Hooker; the latter was what would now be called more\r\nradical than Winthrop or Cotton, the former was more conservative.\r\nIn the New Haven colony none but church-members could vote, and this\r\nmeasure at the outset disfranchised more than half the settlers in New\r\nHaven town, nearly half in Guilford, and less than one fifth in Milford.\r\nThis result was practically less democratic than in Massachusetts where\r\nit was some time before the disfranchisement attained such dimensions.\r\nThe power of the clergy reached its extreme point in New Haven, where\r\neach of the towns was governed by seven ecclesiastical officers known as\r\n\"pillars of the church.\" These magistrates served as judges, and trial\r\nby jury was dispensed with, because no authority could be found for it\r\nin the laws of Moses. The legislation was quaint enough, though the\r\nfamous \"Blue Laws\" of New Haven, which have been made the theme of so\r\nmany jests at the expense of our forefathers, never really existed. The\r\nstory of the Blue Laws was first published in 1781 by the Rev. Samuel\r\nPeters, a Tory refugee in London, who took delight in horrifying our\r\nBritish cousins with tales of wholesale tarring and feathering done by\r\nthe patriots of the Revolution. In point of strict veracity Dr. Peters\r\nreminds one of Baron Munchausen; he declares that the river at Bellows\r\nFalls flows so fast as to float iron crowbars, and he gravely describes\r\nsundry animals who were evidently cousins to the Jabberwok. The most\r\nfamous passage of his pretended code is that which enacts that \"no woman\r\nshall kiss her child on the Sabbath,\" and that \"no one shall play on any\r\ninstrument of music except the drum, trumpet, or jewsharp.\" [Sidenote:\r\nLegend of the \"Blue Laws\"]\r\n\r\nWhen the Long Parliament met in 1640, the Puritan exodus to New England\r\ncame to an end. During the twenty years which had elapsed since the\r\nvoyage of the Mayflower, the population had grown to 26,000 souls. Of\r\nthis number scarcely 500 had arrived before 1629. It is a striking fact,\r\nsince it expresses a causal relation and not a mere coincidence, that\r\nthe eleven years, 1629-1640, during which Charles I. governed England\r\nwithout a parliament, were the same eleven years that witnessed the\r\nplanting of New England. For more than a century after this there was no\r\nconsiderable migration to this part of North America. Puritan England\r\nnow found employment for all its energies and all its enthusiasm at\r\nhome. The struggle with the king and the efforts toward reorganization\r\nunder Cromwell were to occupy it for another score of years, and\r\nthen, by the time of the Restoration the youthful creative energy of\r\nPuritanism had spent itself. The influence of this great movement\r\nwas indeed destined to grow wider and deeper with the progress of\r\ncivilization, but after 1660 its creative work began to run in new\r\nchannels and assume different forms. [Sidenote: End of the Puritan\r\nexodus]\r\n\r\nIt is curious to reflect what might have been the result, to America and\r\nto the world, had things in England gone differently between 1620 and\r\n1660. Had the policy of James and Charles been less formidable, the\r\nPuritan exodus might never have occurred, and the Virginian type of\r\nsociety, varied perhaps by a strong Dutch infusion, might have become\r\nsupreme in America. The western continent would have lost in richness\r\nand variety of life, and it is not likely that Europe would have made a\r\ncorresponding gain, for the moral effect of the challenge, the struggle,\r\nand the overthrow of monarchy in England was a stimulus sorely needed\r\nby neighbouring peoples. It is not always by avoiding the evil, it\r\nis rather by grappling with it and conquering it that character is\r\nstrengthened and life enriched, and there is no better example of this\r\nthan the history of England in the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the Stuart despotism had triumphed in England, the\r\nPuritan exodus would doubtless have been swelled to huge dimensions. New\r\nEngland would have gained strength so quickly that much less irritation\r\nthan she actually suffered between 1664 and 1689 would probably have\r\ngoaded her into rebellion. The war of independence might have been waged\r\na century sooner than it was. It is not easy to point to any especial\r\nadvantage that could have come to America from this; one is rather\r\ninclined to think of the peculiarly valuable political training of the\r\neighteenth century that would have been lost. Such surmises are for the\r\nmost part idle. But as concerns Europe, it is plain to be seen, for\r\nreasons stated in my first chapter, that the decisive victory of Charles\r\nI. would have been a calamity of the first magnitude. It would have been\r\nlike the Greeks losing Marathon or the Saracens winning Tours, supposing\r\nthe worst consequences ever imagined in those hypothetical cases to have\r\nbeen realized. Or taking a more contracted view, we can see how England,\r\nrobbed of her Puritan element, might still have waxed in strength, as\r\nFrance has done in spite of losing the Huguenots; but she could not\r\nhave taken the proud position that she has come to occupy as mother of\r\nnations. Her preeminence since Cromwell\u0027s time has been chiefly due to\r\nher unrivalled power of planting self-supporting colonies, and that\r\npower has had its roots in English self-government. It is the vitality\r\nof the English Idea that is making the language of Cromwell and\r\nWashington dominant in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW ENGLAND CONFEDERACY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Puritan exodus to New England, which came to an end about 1640, was\r\npurely and exclusively English. There was nothing in it that came from\r\nthe continent of Europe, nothing that was either Irish or Scotch, very\r\nlittle that was Welsh. As Palfrey says, the population of 26,000 that\r\nhad been planted in New England by 1640 \"thenceforward continued to\r\nmultiply on its own soil for a century and a half, in remarkable\r\nseclusion from other communities.\" During the whole of this period New\r\nEngland received but few immigrants; and it was not until after the\r\nRevolutionary War that its people had fairly started on their westward\r\nmarch into the state of New York and beyond, until now, after yet\r\nanother century, we find some of their descendants dwelling in a\r\nhomelike Salem and a Portland of charming beauty on the Pacific coast.\r\nThree times between the meeting of the Long Parliament and the meeting\r\nof the Continental Congress did the New England colonies receive a\r\nslight infusion of non-English blood. In 1652, after his victories at\r\nDunbar and Worcester, Cromwell sent 270 of his Scottish prisoners to\r\nBoston, where the descendants of some of them still dwell. After the\r\nrevocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, 150 families of Huguenots\r\ncame to Massachusetts. And finally in 1719, 120 Presbyterian families\r\ncame over from the north of Ireland, and settled at Londonderry in New\r\nHampshire, and elsewhere. In view of these facts it may be said that\r\nthere is not a county in England of which the population is more purely\r\nEnglish than the population of New England at the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. From long and careful research, Mr. Savage, the highest\r\nauthority on this subject, concludes that more than 98 in 100 of the New\r\nEngland people at that time could trace their origin to England in\r\nthe narrowest sense, excluding even Wales. As already observed, every\r\nEnglish shire contributed something to the emigration, but there was\r\na marked preponderance of people from the East Anglian counties.\r\n[Sidenote: The exodus was purely English]\r\n\r\nThe population of New England was nearly as homogeneous in social\r\ncondition as it was in blood. The emigration was preeminent for its\r\nrespectability. Like the best part of the emigration to Virginia, it\r\nconsisted largely of country squires and yeomen. The men who followed\r\nWinthrop were thrifty and prosperous in their old homes from which their\r\ndevotion to an idea made them voluntary exiles. They attached so much\r\nimportance to regular industry and decorous behaviour that for a long\r\ntime the needy and shiftless people who usually make trouble in new\r\ncolonies were not tolerated among them. Hence the early history of New\r\nEngland is remarkably free from those scenes of violence and disorder\r\nwhich have so often made hideous the first years of new communities.\r\nOf negro slaves there were very few, and these were employed wholly in\r\ndomestic service; there were not enough of them to affect the industrial\r\nlife of New England or to be worth mentioning as a class. Neither were\r\nthere many of the wretched people, kidnapped from the jails and slums\r\nof English sea-ports, such as in those early days when negro labour was\r\nscarce, were sent by ship-loads to Virginia, to become the progenitors\r\nof the \"white trash.\" There were a few indented white servants, usually\r\nof the class known as \"redemptioners,\" or immigrants who voluntarily\r\nbound themselves to service for a stated time in order to defray the\r\ncost of their voyage from Europe. At a later time there were many of\r\nthese \"redemptioners\" in the middle colonies, but in New England they\r\nwere very few; and as no stigma of servitude was attached to manual\r\nlabour, they were apt at the end of their terms of service to become\r\nindependent farmers; thus they ceased to be recognizable as a distinct\r\nclass of society. Nevertheless the common statement that no traces of\r\nthe \"mean white\" are to be found in New England is perhaps somewhat\r\ntoo sweeping. Interspersed among those respectable and tidy mountain\r\nvillages, once full of such vigorous life, one sometimes comes upon\r\nlittle isolated groups of wretched hovels whose local reputation is\r\nsufficiently indicated by such terse epithets as \"Hardscrabble\" or\r\n\"Hell-huddle.\" Their denizens may in many instances be the degenerate\r\noffspring of a sound New England stock, but they sometimes show strong\r\npoints of resemblance to that \"white trash\" which has come to be a\r\nrecognizable strain of the English race; and one cannot help suspecting\r\nthat while the New England colonies made every effort to keep out such\r\nriff raff, it may nevertheless have now and then crept in. However this\r\nmay be, it cannot be said that this element ever formed a noticeable\r\nfeature in the life of colonial New England. As regards their social\r\nderivation, the settlers of New England were homogeneous in character to\r\na remarkable degree, and they were drawn from the sturdiest part of\r\nthe English stock. In all history there has been no other instance of\r\ncolonization so exclusively effected by picked and chosen men. The\r\ncolonists knew this, and were proud of it, as well they might be. It was\r\nthe simple truth that was spoken by William Stoughton when he said, in\r\nhis election sermon of 1688: \"God sifted a whole nation, that He might\r\nsend choice grain into the wilderness.\" [Sidenote: Respectable character\r\nof the emigration]\r\n\r\nThis matter comes to have more than a local interest, when we reflect\r\nthat the 26,000 New Englanders of 1640 have in two hundred and fifty\r\nyears increased to something like 15,000,000. From these men have come\r\nat least one-fourth of the present population of the United States.\r\nStriking as this fact may seem, it is perhaps less striking than the\r\nfact of the original migration when duly considered. In these times,\r\nwhen great steamers sail every day from European ports, bringing\r\nimmigrants to a country not less advanced in material civilization\r\nthan the country which they leave, the daily arrival of a thousand new\r\ncitizens has come to be a commonplace event. But in the seventeenth\r\ncentury the transfer of more than twenty thousand well-to-do people\r\nwithin twenty years from their comfortable homes in England to the\r\nAmerican wilderness was by no means a commonplace event. It reminds one\r\nof the migrations of ancient peoples, and in the quaint thought of\r\nour forefathers it was aptly likened to the exodus of Israel from the\r\nEgyptian house of bondage.\r\n\r\nIn this migration a principle of selection was at work which insured an\r\nextraordinary uniformity of character and of purpose among the settlers.\r\nTo this uniformity of purpose, combined with complete homogeneity of\r\nrace, is due the preponderance early acquired by New England in the\r\nhistory of the American people. In view of this, it is worth while to\r\ninquire what were the real aims of the settlers of New England. What was\r\nthe common purpose which brought these men together in their resolve to\r\ncreate for themselves new homes in the wilderness?\r\n\r\nThis is a point concerning which there has been a great deal of popular\r\nmisapprehension, and there has been no end of nonsense talked about it.\r\nIt has been customary first to assume that the Puritan migration was\r\nundertaken in the interests of religious liberty, and then to upbraid\r\nthe Puritans for forgetting all about religious liberty as soon as\r\npeople came among them who disagreed with their opinions. But this view\r\nof the case is not supported by history. It is quite true that the\r\nPuritans were chargeable with gross intolerance; but it is not true that\r\nin this they were guilty of inconsistency. The notion that they came to\r\nNew England for the purpose of establishing religious liberty, in\r\nany sense in which we should understand such a phrase, is entirely\r\nincorrect. It is neither more nor less than a bit of popular legend. If\r\nwe mean by the phrase \"religious liberty\" a state of things in which\r\nopposite or contradictory opinions on questions of religion shall exist\r\nside by side in the same community, and in which everybody shall\r\ndecide for himself how far he will conform to the customary religious\r\nobservances, nothing could have been further from their thoughts. There\r\nis nothing they would have regarded with more genuine abhorrence. If\r\nthey could have been forewarned by a prophetic voice of the general\r\nfreedom--or, as they would have termed it, license--of thought and\r\nbehaviour which prevails in this country to-day, they would very likely\r\nhave abandoned their enterprise in despair. [12] The philosophic student\r\nof history often has occasion to see how God is wiser than man. In other\r\nwords, he is often brought to realize how fortunate it is that the\r\nleaders in great historic events cannot foresee the remote results of\r\nthe labours to which they have zealously consecrated their lives. It is\r\npart of the irony of human destiny that the end we really accomplish by\r\nstriving with might and main is apt to be something quite different from\r\nthe end we dreamed of as we started on our arduous labour. So it was\r\nwith the Puritan settlers of New England. The religious liberty that\r\nwe enjoy to-day is largely the consequence of their work; but it is a\r\nconsequence that was unforeseen, while the direct and conscious aim of\r\ntheir labours was something that has never been realized, and probably\r\nnever will be. [Sidenote: The migration was not intended to promote what\r\nwe call religious liberty]\r\n\r\nThe aim of Winthrop and his friends in coming to Massachusetts was the\r\nconstruction of a theocratic state which should be to Christians, under\r\nthe New Testament dispensation, all that the theocracy of Moses and\r\nJoshua and Samuel had been to the Jews in Old Testament days. They\r\nshould be to all intents and purposes freed from the jurisdiction of\r\nthe Stuart king, and so far as possible the text of the Holy Scriptures\r\nshould be their guide both in weighty matters of general legislation and\r\nin the shaping of the smallest details of daily life. In such a scheme\r\nthere was no room for religious liberty as we understand it. No doubt\r\nthe text of the Scriptures may be interpreted in many ways, but among\r\nthese men there was a substantial agreement as to the important points,\r\nand nothing could have been further from their thoughts than to found\r\na colony which should afford a field for new experiments in the art of\r\nright living. The state they were to found was to consist of a united\r\nbody of believers; citizenship itself was to be co-extensive with\r\nchurch-membership; and in such a state there was apparently no more room\r\nfor heretics than there was in Rome or Madrid. This was the idea which\r\ndrew Winthrop and his followers from England at a time when--as events\r\nwere soon to show--they might have stayed there and defied persecution\r\nwith less trouble than it cost them to cross the ocean and found a new\r\nstate. [Sidenote: Theocratic ideal of the Puritans]\r\n\r\nSuch an ideal as this, considered by itself and apart from the concrete\r\nacts in which it was historically manifested, may seem like the merest\r\nfanaticism. But we cannot dismiss in this summary way a movement which\r\nhas been at the source of so much that is great in American history:\r\nmere fanaticism has never produced such substantial results. Mere\r\nfanaticism is sure to aim at changing the constitution of human society\r\nin some essential point, to undo the work of evolution, and offer in\r\nsome indistinctly apprehended fashion to remodel human life. But in\r\nthese respects the Puritans were intensely conservative. The impulse by\r\nwhich they were animated was a profoundly ethical impulse--the desire\r\nto lead godly lives, and to drive out sin from the community--the same\r\nethical impulse which animates the glowing pages of Hebrew poets and\r\nprophets, and which has given to the history and literature of Israel\r\ntheir commanding influence in the world. The Greek, says Matthew Arnold,\r\nheld that the perfection of happiness was to have one\u0027s thoughts hit the\r\nmark; but the Hebrew held that it was to serve the Lord day and night.\r\nIt was a touch of this inspiration that the Puritan caught from his\r\nearnest and reverent study of the sacred text, and that served to\r\njustify and intensify his yearning for a better life, and to give it\r\nthe character of a grand and holy ideal. Yet with all this religious\r\nenthusiasm, the Puritan was in every fibre a practical Englishman with\r\nhis full share of plain common-sense. He avoided the error of\r\nmediaeval anchorites and mystics in setting an exaggerated value upon\r\notherworldliness. In his desire to win a crown of glory hereafter he did\r\nnot forget that the present life has its simple duties, in the exact\r\nperformance of which the welfare of society mainly consists. He likewise\r\navoided the error of modern radicals who would remodel the fundamental\r\ninstitutions of property and of the family, and thus disturb the very\r\ngroundwork of our ethical ideals. The Puritan\u0027s ethical conception of\r\nsociety was simply that which has grown up in the natural course of\r\nhistorical evolution, and which in its essential points is therefore\r\nintelligible to all men, and approved by the common-sense of men,\r\nhowever various may be the terminology--whether theological or\r\nscientific--in which it is expounded. For these reasons there was\r\nnothing essentially fanatical or impracticable in the Puritan scheme: in\r\nsubstance it was something that great bodies of men could at once put\r\ninto practice, while its quaint and peculiar form was something that\r\ncould be easily and naturally outgrown and set aside. [Sidenote: The\r\nimpulse which sought to realize itself in the Puritan ideal was an\r\nethical impulse]\r\n\r\nYet another point in which the Puritan scheme of a theocratic society\r\nwas rational and not fanatical was its method of interpreting the\r\nScriptures. That method was essentially rationalistic in two ways.\r\nFirst, the Puritan laid no claim to the possession of any peculiar\r\ninspiration or divine light whereby he might be aided in ascertaining\r\nthe meaning of the sacred text; but he used his reason just as he would\r\nin any matter of business, and he sought to convince, and expected to\r\nbe convinced, by rational argument, and by nothing else. Secondly, it\r\nfollowed from this denial of any peculiar inspiration that there was no\r\nroom in the Puritan commonwealth for anything like a priestly class, and\r\nthat every individual must hold his own opinions at his own personal\r\nrisk. The consequences of this rationalistic spirit have been very\r\nfar-reaching. In the conviction that religious opinion must be consonant\r\nwith reason, and that religious truth must be brought home to each\r\nindividual by rational argument, we may find one of the chief causes of\r\nthat peculiarly conservative yet flexible intelligence which has enabled\r\nthe Puritan countries to take the lead in the civilized world of\r\ntoday. Free discussion of theological questions, when conducted with\r\nearnestness and reverence, and within certain generally acknowledged\r\nlimits, was never discountenanced in New England. On the contrary, there\r\nhas never been a society in the world in which theological problems have\r\nbeen so seriously and persistently discussed as in New England in the\r\ncolonial period. The long sermons of the clergymen were usually learned\r\nand elaborate arguments of doctrinal points, bristling with quotations\r\nfrom the Bible, or from famous books of controversial divinity, and in\r\nthe long winter evenings the questions thus raised afforded the occasion\r\nfor lively debate in every household. The clergy were, as a rule, men\r\nof learning, able to read both Old and New Testaments in the original\r\nlanguages, and familiar with the best that had been talked and written,\r\namong Protestants at least, on theological subjects. They were also, for\r\nthe most part, men of lofty character, and they were held in high social\r\nesteem on account of their character and scholarship, as well as on\r\naccount of their clerical position. But in spite of the reverence in\r\nwhich they were commonly held, it would have been a thing quite unheard\r\nof for one of these pastors to urge an opinion from the pulpit on the\r\nsole ground of his personal authority or his superior knowledge of\r\nScriptural exegesis. The hearers, too, were quick to detect novelties\r\nor variations in doctrine; and while there was perhaps no more than the\r\nordinary human unwillingness to listen to a new thought merely because\r\nof its newness, it was above all things needful that the orthodox\r\nsoundness of every new suggestion should be thoroughly and severely\r\ntested. This intense interest in doctrinal theology was part and parcel\r\nof the whole theory of New England life; because, as I have said, it was\r\ntaken for granted that each individual must hold his own opinions at\r\nhis own personal risk in the world to come. Such perpetual discussion,\r\nconducted, under such a stimulus, afforded in itself no mean school\r\nof intellectual training. Viewed in relation to the subsequent mental\r\nactivity of New England, it may be said to have occupied a position\r\nsomewhat similar to that which the polemics of the medieval schoolmen\r\noccupied in relation to the European thought of the Renaissance, and of\r\nthe age of Hobbes and Descartes. At the same time the Puritan theory of\r\nlife lay at the bottom of the whole system of popular education in New\r\nEngland. According to that theory, it was absolutely essential that\r\nevery one should be taught from early childhood how to read and\r\nunderstand the Bible. So much instruction as this was assumed to be a\r\nsacred duty which the community owed to every child born within its\r\njurisdiction. In ignorance, the Puritans maintained, lay the principal\r\nstrength of popery in religion as well as of despotism in politics; and\r\nso, to the best of their lights, they cultivated knowledge with might\r\nand main. But in this energetic diffusion of knowledge they were\r\nunwittingly preparing the complete and irreparable destruction of the\r\ntheocratic ideal of society which they had sought to realize by crossing\r\nthe ocean and settling in New England. This universal education, and\r\nthis perpetual discussion of theological questions, were no more\r\ncompatible with rigid adherence to the Calvinistic system than with\r\nsubmission to the absolute rule of Rome. The inevitable result was the\r\nliberal and enlightened Protestantism which is characteristic of the\r\nbest American society at the present day, and which is continually\r\ngrowing more liberal as it grows more enlightened--a Protestantism\r\nwhich, in the natural course of development, is coming to realize the\r\nnoble ideal of Roger Williams, but from the very thought of which such\r\nmen as Winthrop and Cotton and Endicott would have shrunk with dismay.\r\n[Sidenote: In interpreting Scripture, the Puritan appealed to his\r\nreason] [Sidenote: Value of theological discussion]\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is interesting to note the similarity between the\r\nexperience of the Puritans in New England and in Scotland with respect\r\nto the influence of their religious theory of life upon general\r\neducation. Nowhere has Puritanism, with its keen intelligence and its\r\niron tenacity of purpose, played a greater part than it has played in\r\nthe history of Scotland. And one need not fear contradiction in saying\r\nthat no other people in modern times, in proportion to their numbers,\r\nhave achieved so much in all departments of human activity as the people\r\nof Scotland have achieved. It would be superfluous to mention the\r\npreeminence of Scotland in the industrial arts since the days of James\r\nWatt, or to recount the glorious names in philosophy, in history, in\r\npoetry and romance, and in every department of science, which since the\r\nmiddle of the eighteenth century have made the country of Burns and\r\nScott, of Hume and Adam Smith, of Black and Hunter and Hutton and\r\nLyell, illustrious for all future time. Now this period of magnificent\r\nintellectual fruition in Scotland was preceded by a period of\r\nCalvinistic orthodoxy quite as rigorous as that of New England. The\r\nministers of the Scotch Kirk in the seventeenth century cherished a\r\ntheocratic ideal of society not unlike that which the colonists of New\r\nEngland aimed at realizing. There was the same austerity, the same\r\nintolerance, the same narrowness of interests, in Scotland that there\r\nwas in New England. Mr. Buckle, in the book which thirty years ago\r\nseemed so great and stimulating, gave us a graphic picture of this state\r\nof society, and the only thing which he could find to say about it, as\r\nthe result of his elaborate survey, was that the spirit of the Scotch\r\nKirk was as thoroughly hostile to human progress as the spirit of the\r\nSpanish Inquisition! If this were really so, it would be difficult\r\nindeed to account for the period of brilliant mental activity which\r\nimmediately followed. But in reality the Puritan theory of life led\r\nto general education in Scotland as it did in New England, and for\r\nprecisely the same reasons, while the effects of theological discussion\r\nin breaking down the old Calvinistic exclusiveness have been illustrated\r\nin the history of Edinburgh as well as in the history of Boston.\r\n[Sidenote: Comparison with the case of Scotland]\r\n\r\nIt is well for us to bear in mind the foregoing considerations as we\r\ndeal with the history of the short-lived New England Confederacy. The\r\nstory is full of instances of an intolerant and domineering spirit,\r\nespecially on the part of Massachusetts, and now and then this spirit\r\nbreaks forth in ugly acts of persecution. In considering these facts, it\r\nis well to remember that we are observing the workings of a system\r\nwhich contained within itself a curative principle; and it is further\r\ninteresting to observe how political circumstances contributed to\r\nmodify the Puritan ideal, gradually breaking down the old theocratic\r\nexclusiveness and strengthening the spirit of religious liberty.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the first New England colonies been established when it was\r\nfound desirable to unite them into some kind of a confederation. It is\r\nworthy of note that the separate existence of so many colonies was at\r\nthe outset largely the result of religious differences. The uniformity\r\nof purpose, great as it was, fell far short of completeness. [Sidenote:\r\nExistence of so many colonies due to slight religious differences]\r\n\r\nCould all have agreed, or had there been religious toleration in the\r\nmodern sense, there was still room enough for all in Massachusetts;\r\nand a compact settlement would have been in much less danger from the\r\nIndians. But in the founding of Connecticut the theocratic idea had less\r\nweight, and in the founding of New Haven it had more weight, than\r\nin Massachusetts. The existence of Rhode Island was based upon that\r\nprinciple of full toleration which the three colonies just mentioned\r\nalike abhorred, and its first settlers were people banished from\r\nMassachusetts. With regard to toleration Plymouth occupied a middle\r\nground; without admitting the principles of Williams, the people of that\r\ncolony were still fairly tolerant in practice. Of the four towns of New\r\nHampshire, two had been founded by Antinomians driven from Boston, and\r\ntwo by Episcopal friends of Mason and Gorges. It was impossible that\r\nneighbouring communities, characterized by such differences of opinion,\r\nbut otherwise homogeneous in race and in social condition, should fail\r\nto react upon one another and to liberalize one another. Still more was\r\nthis true when they attempted to enter into a political union. When, for\r\nexample, Massachusetts in 1641-43 annexed the New Hampshire townships,\r\nshe was of necessity obliged to relax in their case her policy of\r\ninsisting upon religious conformity as a test of citizenship. So in\r\nforming the New England Confederacy, there were some matters of dispute\r\nthat had to be passed over by mutual consent or connivance. [Sidenote:\r\nIt led to a notable attempt at federation]\r\n\r\nThe same causes which had spread the English settlements over so wide a\r\nterritory now led, as an indirect result, to their partial union into a\r\nconfederacy. The immediate consequence of the westward movement had been\r\nan Indian war. Several savage tribes were now interspersed between the\r\nsettlements, so that it became desirable that the military force should\r\nbe brought, as far as possible, under one management. The colony of\r\nNew Netherlands, moreover, had begun to assume importance, and the\r\nsettlements west of the Connecticut river had already occasioned hard\r\nwords between Dutch and English, which might at any moment be followed\r\nby blows. In the French colonies at the north, with their extensive\r\nIndian alliances under Jesuit guidance, the Puritans saw a rival power\r\nwhich was likely in course of time to prove troublesome. With a view to\r\nmore efficient self-defence, therefore, in 1643 the four colonies of\r\nMassachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven formed themselves\r\ninto a league, under the style of \"The United Colonies of New England.\"\r\nThese four little states now contained thirty-nine towns, with an\r\naggregate population of 24,000. To the northeast of Massachusetts,\r\nwhich now extended to the Piscataqua, a small colony had at length been\r\nconstituted under a proprietary charter somewhat similar to that held by\r\nthe Calverts in Maryland. Of this new province or palatinate of Maine\r\nthe aged Sir Ferdinando Gorges was Lord Proprietary, and he had\r\nundertaken not only to establish the Church of England there, but also\r\nto introduce usages of feudal jurisdiction like those remaining in the\r\nold country. Such a community was not likely to join the Confederacy;\r\napart from other reasons, its proprietary constitution and the feud\r\nbetween the Puritans and Gorges would have been sufficient obstacles.\r\n\r\nAs for Rhode Island, on the other hand, it was regarded with strong\r\ndislike by the other colonies. It was a curious and noteworthy\r\nconsequence of the circumstances under which this little state was\r\nfounded that for a long time it became the refuge of all the fanatical\r\nand turbulent people who could not submit to the strict and orderly\r\ngovernments of Connecticut or Massachusetts. All extremes met on\r\nNarragansett bay. There were not only sensible advocates of religious\r\nliberty, but theocrats as well who saw flaws in the theocracy of\r\nother Puritans. The English world was then in a state of theological\r\nfermentation. People who fancied themselves favoured with direct\r\nrevelations from Heaven; people who thought it right to keep the seventh\r\nday of the week as a Sabbath instead of the first day; people who\r\ncherished a special predilection for the Apocalypse and the Book of\r\nDaniel; people with queer views about property and government; people\r\nwho advocated either too little marriage or too much marriage; all such\r\neccentric characters as are apt to come to the surface in periods of\r\nreligious excitement found in Rhode Island a favoured spot where they\r\ncould prophesy without let or hindrance. But the immediate practical\r\nresult of so much discordance in opinion was the impossibility of\r\nfounding a strong and well-ordered government. The early history of\r\nRhode Island was marked by enough of turbulence to suggest the question\r\nwhether, after all, at the bottom of the Puritan\u0027s refusal to recognize\r\nthe doctrine of private inspiration, or to tolerate indiscriminately all\r\nsorts of opinions, there may not have been a grain of shrewd political\r\nsense not ill adapted to the social condition of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. In 1644 and again in 1648 the Narragansett settlers asked leave\r\nto join the Confederacy; but the request was refused on the ground\r\nthat they had no stable government of their own. They were offered\r\nthe alternative of voluntary annexation either to Massachusetts or to\r\nPlymouth, or of staying out in the cold; and they chose the latter\r\ncourse. Early in 1643 they had sent Roger Williams over to England to\r\nobtain a charter for Rhode Island. In that year Parliament created a\r\nBoard of Commissioners, with the Earl of Warwick at its head, for the\r\nsuperintendence of colonial affairs; and nothing could better illustrate\r\nthe loose and reckless manner in which American questions were treated\r\nin England than the first proceedings of this board. It gave an early\r\ninstance of British carelessness in matters of American geography. In\r\nDecember, 1643, it granted to Massachusetts all the territory on the\r\nmainland of Narragansett bay; and in the following March it incorporated\r\nthe townships of Newport and Portsmouth, which stood on the island,\r\ntogether with Providence, which stood on the mainland, into an\r\nindependent colony empowered to frame a government and make laws for\r\nitself. With this second document Williams returned to Providence in the\r\nautumn of 1644. Just how far it was intended to cancel the first one,\r\nnobody could tell, but it plainly afforded an occasion for a conflict of\r\nclaims. [Sidenote: Turbulence of dissent in Rhode Island] [Sidenote: The\r\nEarl of Warwick and his Board of Commissioners]\r\n\r\nThe league of the four colonies is interesting as the first American\r\nexperiment in federation. By the articles it was agreed that each colony\r\nshould retain full independence so far as concerned the management of\r\nits internal affairs, but that the confederate government should have\r\nentire control over all dealings with the Indians or with foreign\r\npowers. The administration of the league was put into the hands of\r\na board of eight Federal Commissioners, two from each colony. The\r\ncommissioners were required to be church-members in good standing. They\r\ncould choose for themselves a president or chairman out of their own\r\nnumber, but such a president was to have no more power than the other\r\nmembers of the Board. If any measure were to come up concerning\r\nwhich the commissioners could not agree, it was to be referred for\r\nconsideration to the legislatures or general courts of the four\r\ncolonies. Expenses for war were to be charged to each colony in\r\nproportion to the number of males in each between sixteen years of\r\nage and sixty. A meeting of the Board might be summoned by any two\r\nmagistrates whenever the public safety might seem to require it; but a\r\nregular meeting was to be held once every year.\r\n\r\nIn this scheme of confederacy all power of taxation was expressly left\r\nto the several colonies. The scheme provided for a mere league, not for\r\na federal union. The government of the Commissioners acted only upon the\r\nlocal governments, not upon individuals. The Board had thus but little\r\nexecutive power, and was hardly more than a consulting body. Another\r\nsource of weakness in the confederacy was the overwhelming preponderance\r\nof Massachusetts. Of the 24,000 people in the confederation, 15,000\r\nbelonged to Massachusetts, while the other three colonies had only about\r\n3,000 each. Massachusetts accordingly had to carry the heaviest burden,\r\nboth in the furnishing of soldiers and in the payment of war expenses,\r\nwhile in the direction of affairs she had no more authority than one of\r\nthe small colonies. As a natural consequence, Massachusetts tried\r\nto exert more authority than she was entitled to by the articles of\r\nconfederation; and such conduct was not unnaturally resented by the\r\nsmall colonies, as betokening an unfair and domineering spirit. In\r\nspite of these drawbacks, however, the league was of great value to\r\nNew England. On many occasions it worked well as a high court of\r\njurisdiction, and it made the military strength of the colonies more\r\navailable than it would otherwise have been. But for the interference\r\nof the British government, which brought it to an untimely end, the\r\nConfederacy might have been gradually amended so as to become enduring.\r\nAfter its downfall it was pleasantly remembered by the people of New\r\nEngland; in times of trouble their thoughts reverted to it; and the\r\nhistorian must in fairness assign it some share in preparing men\u0027s minds\r\nfor the greater work of federation which was achieved before the end of\r\nthe following century. [Sidenote: It was only a league, not a federal\r\nunion]\r\n\r\nThe formation of such a confederacy certainly involved something very\r\nlike a tacit assumption of sovereignty on the part of the four colonies.\r\nIt is worthy of note that they did not take the trouble to ask the\r\npermission of the home government in advance. They did as they pleased,\r\nand then defended their action afterward. In England the act of\r\nconfederation was regarded with jealousy and distrust. But Edward\r\nWinslow, who was sent over to London to defend the colonies, pithily\r\nsaid: \"If we in America should forbear to unite for offence and defence\r\nagainst a common enemy till we have leave from England, our throats\r\nmight be all cut before the messenger would be half seas through.\"\r\nWhether such considerations would have had weight with Charles I. or not\r\nwas now of little consequence. His power of making mischief soon came\r\nto an end, and from the liberal and sagacious policy of Cromwell the\r\nConfederacy had not much to fear. Nevertheless the fall of Charles I.\r\nbrought up for the first time that question which a century later was\r\nto acquire surpassing interest,--the question as to the supremacy of\r\nParliament over the colonies.\r\n\r\nDown to this time the supreme control over colonial affairs had been in\r\nthe hands of the king and his privy council, and the Parliament had\r\nnot disputed it. In 1624 they had grumbled at James I.\u0027s high-handed\r\nsuppression of the Virginia Company, but they had not gone so far as\r\nto call in question the king\u0027s supreme authority over the colonies. In\r\n1628, in a petition to Charles I. relating to the Bermudas, they had\r\nfully admitted this royal authority. But the fall of Charles I. for the\r\nmoment changed all this. Among the royal powers devolved upon Parliament\r\nwas the prerogative of superintending the affairs of the colonies. Such,\r\nat least, was the theory held in England, and it is not easy to see how\r\nany other theory could logically have been held; but the Americans never\r\nformally admitted it, and in practice they continued to behave toward\r\nParliament very much as they had behaved toward the crown, yielding\r\njust as little obedience as possible. When the Earl of Warwick\u0027s\r\ncommissioners in 1644 seized upon a royalist vessel in Boston harbour,\r\nthe legislature of Massachusetts debated the question whether it was\r\ncompatible with the dignity of the colony to permit such an act of\r\nsovereignty on the part of Parliament. It was decided to wink at the\r\nproceeding, on account of the strong sympathy between Massachusetts and\r\nthe Parliament which was overthrowing the king. At the same time the\r\nlegislature sent over to London a skilfully worded protest against\r\nany like exercise of power in future. In 1651 Parliament ordered\r\nMassachusetts to surrender the charter obtained from Charles I. and take\r\nout a new one from Parliament, in which the relations of the colony to\r\nthe home government should be made the subject of fresh and more precise\r\ndefinition. To this request the colony for more than a year vouchsafed\r\nno answer; and finally, when it became necessary to do something,\r\ninstead of sending back the charter, the legislature sent back a\r\nmemorial, setting forth that the people of Massachusetts were quite\r\ncontented with their form of government, and hoped that no change would\r\nbe made in it. War between England and Holland, and the difficult\r\npolitical problems which beset the brief rule of Cromwell, prevented\r\nthe question from coming to an issue, and Massachusetts was enabled to\r\npreserve her independent and somewhat haughty attitude. [Sidenote: Fall\r\nof Charles I. brings up the question as to supremacy of Parliament over\r\nthe colonies]\r\n\r\nDuring the whole period of the Confederacy, however, disputes kept\r\ncoming up which through endless crooked ramifications were apt to end\r\nin an appeal to the home government, and thus raise again and again the\r\nquestion as to the extent of its imperial supremacy. For our present\r\npurpose, it is enough to mention three of these cases: 1, the adventures\r\nof Samuel Gorton; 2, the Presbyterian cabal; 3, the persecution of the\r\nQuakers. Other cases in point are those of John Clarke and the Baptists,\r\nand the relations of Massachusetts to the northeastern settlements; but\r\nas it is not my purpose here to make a complete outline of New England\r\nhistory, the three cases enumerated will suffice.\r\n\r\nThe first case shows, in a curious and instructive way, how religious\r\ndissensions were apt to be complicated with threats of an Indian war on\r\nthe one hand and peril from Great Britain on the other; and as we come\r\nto realize the triple danger, we can perhaps make some allowances for\r\nthe high-handed measures with which the Puritan governments sometimes\r\nsought to avert it. [Genesis of the persecuting spirit]\r\n\r\nAs I have elsewhere tried to show, the genesis of the persecuting spirit\r\nis to be found in the conditions of primitive society, where \"above\r\nall things the prime social and political necessity is social cohesion\r\nwithin the tribal limits, for unless such social cohesion be maintained,\r\nthe very existence of the tribe is likely to be extinguished in\r\nbloodshed.\" The persecuting spirit \"began to pass away after men\r\nhad become organized into great nations, covering a vast extent of\r\nterritory, and secured by their concentrated military strength against\r\nthe gravest dangers of barbaric attack.\" [13]\r\n\r\nNow as regards these considerations, the Puritan communities in the\r\nNew England wilderness were to some slight extent influenced by such\r\nconditions as used to prevail in primitive society; and this will help\r\nus to understand the treatment of the Antinomians and such cases as that\r\nwith which we have now to deal.\r\n\r\nAmong the supporters of Mrs. Hutchinson, after her arrival at Aquedneck,\r\nwas a sincere and courageous, but incoherent and crotchetty man named\r\nSamuel Gorton. [Sidenote: Samuel Gorton]\r\n\r\nIn the denunciatory language of that day he was called a \"proud and\r\npestilent seducer,\" or, as the modern newspaper would say, a \"crank.\" It\r\nis well to make due allowances for the prejudice so conspicuous in the\r\naccounts given by his enemies, who felt obliged to justify their harsh\r\ntreatment of him. But we have also his own writings from which to form\r\nan opinion as to his character and views. Lucidity, indeed, was not one\r\nof his strong points as a writer, and the drift of his argument is not\r\nalways easy to decipher; but he seems to have had some points of contact\r\nwith the Familists, a sect established in the sixteenth century in\r\nHolland. The Familists held that the essence of religion consists not\r\nin adherence to any particular creed or ritual, but in cherishing the\r\nspirit of divine love. The general adoption of this point of view was to\r\ninaugurate a third dispensation, superior to those of Moses and Christ,\r\nthe dispensation of the Holy Ghost. The value of the Bible lay not so\r\nmuch in the literal truth of its texts as in their spiritual import;\r\nand by the union of believers with Christ they came to share in the\r\nineffable perfection of the Godhead. There is much that is modern and\r\nenlightened in such views, which Gorton seems to some extent to have\r\nshared. He certainly set little store by ritual observances and\r\nmaintained the equal right of laymen with clergymen to preach the\r\ngospel. Himself a London clothier, and thanking God that he had not been\r\nbrought up in \"the schools of human learning,\" he set up as a preacher\r\nwithout ordination, and styled himself \"professor of the mysteries of\r\nChrist.\" He seems to have cherished that doctrine of private inspiration\r\nwhich the Puritans especially abhorred. It is not likely that he had any\r\ndistinct comprehension of his own views, for distinctness was just what\r\nthey lacked. [14] But they were such as in the seventeenth century could\r\nnot fail to arouse fierce antagonism, and if it was true that wherever\r\nthere was a government Gorton was against it, perhaps that only shows\r\nthat wherever there was a government it was sure to be against him.\r\n\r\nIn the case of such men as Gorton, however,--and the type is by no\r\nmeans an uncommon one,--their temperament usually has much more to do\r\nwith getting them into trouble than their opinions. Gorton\u0027s temperament\r\nwas such as to keep him always in an atmosphere of strife. Other\r\nheresiarchs suffered persecution in Massachusetts, but Gorton was in hot\r\nwater everywhere. His arrival in any community was the signal for an\r\nimmediate disturbance of the peace. His troubles began in Plymouth,\r\nwhere the wife of the pastor preferred his teachings to those of her\r\nhusband. In 1638 he fled to Aquedneck, where his first achievement was a\r\nschism among Mrs. Hutchinson\u0027s followers, which ended in some staying to\r\nfound the town of Portsmouth while others went away to found Newport.\r\nPresently Portsmouth found him intolerable, flogged and banished him,\r\nand after his departure was able to make up its quarrel with Newport.\r\nHe next made his way with a few followers to Pawtuxet, within the\r\njurisdiction of Providence, and now it is the broad-minded and gentle\r\nRoger Williams who complains of his \"bewitching and madding poor\r\nProvidence.\" The question is here suggested what could it have been\r\nin Gorton\u0027s teaching that enabled him thus to \"bewitch\" these little\r\ncommunities? We may be sure that it could not have been the element of\r\nmodern liberalism suggested in the Familistic doctrines above cited.\r\nThat was the feature then least likely to appeal to the minds of common\r\npeople, and most likely to appeal to Williams. More probably such\r\nsuccess as Gorton had in winning followers was due to some of the\r\nmystical rubbish which abounds in his pages and finds in a modern mind\r\nno doorway through which to enter. [Sidenote: He flees to Aquedneck and\r\nis banished thence]\r\n\r\nWilliams disapproved of Gorton, but was true to his principles of\r\ntoleration and would not take part in any attempt to silence him. But in\r\n1641 we find thirteen leading citizens of Providence, headed by William\r\nArnold, [15] sending a memorial to Boston, asking for assistance and\r\ncounsel in regard to this disturber of the peace. How was Massachusetts\r\nto treat such an appeal? She could not presume to meddle with the affair\r\nunless she could have permanent jurisdiction over Pawtuxet; otherwise\r\nshe was a mere intruder. How strong a side-light does this little\r\nincident throw upon the history of the Roman republic, and of all\r\nrelatively strong communities when confronted with the problem of\r\npreserving order in neighbouring states that are too weak to preserve it\r\nfor themselves! Arnold\u0027s argument, in his appeal to Massachusetts, was\r\nprecisely the same as that by which the latter colony excused herself\r\nfor banishing the Antinomians. He simply says that Gorton and his\r\ncompany \"are not fit persons to be received, and made members of a body\r\nin so weak a state as our town is in at present;\" and he adds, \"There is\r\nno state but in the first place will seek to preserve its own safety and\r\npeace.\" Whatever might be the abstract merits of Gorton\u0027s opinions, his\r\nconduct was politically dangerous; and accordingly the jurisdiction over\r\nPawtuxet was formally conceded to Massachusetts. Thereupon that colony,\r\nassuming jurisdiction, summoned Gorton and his men to Boston, to prove\r\ntheir title to the lands they occupied. They of course regarded the\r\nsummons as a flagrant usurpation of authority, and instead of obeying\r\nit they withdrew to Shawomet, on the western shore of Narragansett bay,\r\nwhere they bought a tract of land from the principal sachem of the\r\nNarragansetts, Miantonomo. The immediate rule over this land belonged to\r\ntwo inferior chiefs, who ratified the sale at the time, but six months\r\nafterward disavowed the ratification, on the ground that it had been\r\ngiven under duress from their overlord Miantonomo. Here was a state\r\nof things which might easily bring on an Indian war. The two chiefs\r\nappealed to Massachusetts for protection, and were accordingly summoned,\r\nalong with Miantonomo, to a hearing at Boston. Here we see how a kind of\r\nEnglish protectorate over the native tribes had begun to grow up so soon\r\nafter the destruction of the Pequots. Such a result was inevitable.\r\nAfter hearing the arguments, the legislature decided to defend the two\r\nchiefs, provided they would put themselves under the jurisdiction of\r\nMassachusetts. This was done, while further complaints against Gorton\r\ncame from the citizens of Providence. Gorton and his men were now\r\nperemptorily summoned to Boston to show cause why they should not\r\nsurrender their land at Shawomet and to answer the charges against them.\r\nOn receiving from Gorton a defiant reply, couched in terms which some\r\nthought blasphemous, the government of Massachusetts prepared to use\r\nforce. [Sidenote: Providence protests against him] [Sidenote: He flees\r\nto Shawomet, where he buys land of the Indians]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the unfortunate Miantonomo had rushed upon his doom. The\r\nannihilation of the Pequots had left the Mohegans and Narragansetts\r\ncontending for the foremost place among the native tribes. Between the\r\nrival sachems, Uncas and Miantonomo, the hatred was deep and deadly.\r\nAs soon as the Mohegan perceived that trouble was brewing between\r\nMiantonomo and the government at Boston, he improved the occasion by\r\ngathering a few Narragansett scalps. Miantonomo now took the war-path\r\nand was totally defeated by Uncas in a battle on the Great Plain in the\r\npresent township of Norwich. Encumbered with a coat of mail which his\r\nfriend Gorton had given him, Miantonomo was overtaken and captured. By\r\nordinary Indian usage he would have been put to death with fiendish\r\ntorments, as soon as due preparations could be made and a fit company\r\nassembled to gloat over his agony; but Gorton sent a messenger to Uncas,\r\nthreatening dire vengeance if harm were done to his ally. This message\r\npuzzled the Mohegan chief. The appearance of a schism in the English\r\ncounsels was more than he could quite fathom. When the affair had\r\nsomewhat more fully developed itself, some of the Indians spoke of\r\nthe white men as divided into two rival tribes, the Gortonoges and\r\nWattaconoges. [16] Roger Williams tells us that the latter term, applied\r\nto the men of Boston, meant coat-wearers. Whether it is to be inferred\r\nthat the Gortonoges went about in what in modern parlance would be\r\ncalled their \"shirt-sleeves,\" the reader must decide. [Sidenote:\r\nMiantonomo and Uncas]\r\n\r\nIn his perplexity Uncas took his prisoner to Hartford, and afterward,\r\nupon the advice of the governor and council, sent him to Boston, that\r\nhis fate might be determined by the Federal Commissioners who were\r\nthere holding their first regular meeting. It was now the turn of the\r\ncommissioners to be perplexed. According to English law there was no\r\ngood reason for putting Miantonomo to death. The question was whether\r\nthey should interfere with the Indian custom by which his life was\r\nalready forfeit to his captor. The magistrates already suspected the\r\nNarragansetts of cherishing hostile designs. To set their sachem at\r\nliberty, especially while the Gorton affair remained unsettled, might be\r\ndangerous; and it would be likely to alienate Uncas from the English. In\r\ntheir embarrassment the commissioners sought spiritual guidance. A synod\r\nof forty or fifty clergymen, from all parts of New England, was in\r\nsession at Boston, and the question was referred to a committee of five\r\nof their number. The decision was prompt that Miantonomo must die. He\r\nwas sent back to Hartford to be slain by Uncas, but two messengers\r\naccompanied him, to see that no tortures were inflicted. A select band\r\nof Mohegan warriors journeyed through the forest with the prisoner and\r\nthe two Englishmen, until they came to the plain where the battle had\r\nbeen fought. Then at a signal from Uncas, the warrior walking behind\r\nMiantonomo silently lifted his tomahawk and sank it into the brain of\r\nthe victim who fell dead without a groan. Uncas cut a warm slice from\r\nthe shoulder and greedily devoured it, declaring that the flesh of\r\nhis enemy was the sweetest of meat and gave strength to his heart.\r\nMiantonomo was buried there on the scene of his defeat, which has ever\r\nsince been known as the Sachem\u0027s Plain. This was in September, 1643, and\r\nfor years afterward, in that month, parties of Narragansetts used to\r\nvisit the spot and with frantic gestures and hideous yells lament their\r\nfallen leader. A heap of stones was raised over the grave, and no\r\nNarragansett came near it without adding to the pile. After many a\r\nsummer had passed and the red men had disappeared from the land, a\r\nYankee farmer, with whom thrift prevailed over sentiment, cleared away\r\nthe mound and used the stones for the foundation of his new barn. [17]\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Miantonomo]\r\n\r\nOne cannot regard this affair as altogether creditable to the Federal\r\nCommissioners and their clerical advisers. One of the clearest-headed\r\nand most impartial students of our history observes that \"if the English\r\nwere to meddle in the matter at all, it was their clear duty to enforce\r\nas far as might be the principles recognized by civilized men. When they\r\naccepted the appeal made by Uncas they shifted the responsibility from\r\nthe Mohegan chief to themselves.\" [18] The decision was doubtless based\r\npurely upon grounds of policy. Miantonomo was put out of the way because\r\nhe was believed to be dangerous. In the thirst for revenge that was\r\naroused among the Narragansetts there was an alternative source of\r\ndanger, to which I shall hereafter refer. [19] It is difficult now to\r\ndecide, as a mere question of safe policy, what the English ought to\r\nhave done. The chance of being dragged into an Indian war, through the\r\nfeud between Narragansetts and Mohegans, was always imminent. The policy\r\nwhich condemned Miantonomo was one of timidity, and fear is merciless.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Commissioners heartily approved the conduct of Massachusetts\r\ntoward Gorton, and adopted it in the name of the United Colonies. After\r\na formal warning, which passed unheeded, a company of forty men, under\r\nEdward Johnson of Woburn and two other officers, was sent to Shawomet.\r\nSome worthy citizens of Providence essayed to play the part of\r\nmediators, and after some parley the Gortonites offered to submit to\r\narbitration. The proposal was conveyed to Boston, and the clergy were\r\nagain consulted. They declared it beneath the dignity of Massachusetts\r\nto negotiate \"with a few fugitives living without law or government,\"\r\nand they would no more compound with Gorton\u0027s \"blasphemous revilings\"\r\nthan they would bargain with the Evil One. The community must be\r\n\"purged\" of such wickedness, either by repentance or by punishment. The\r\nministers felt that God would hold the community responsible for Gorton\r\nand visit calamities upon them unless he were silenced. [20] The\r\narbitration was refused, Gorton\u0027s blockhouse was besieged and captured,\r\nand the agitator was carried with nine of his followers to Boston, where\r\nthey were speedily convicted of heresy and sedition. Before passing\r\njudgment the General Court as usual consulted with the clergy who\r\nrecommended a sentence of death. Their advice was adopted by the\r\nassistants, but the deputies were more merciful, and the heretics\r\nwere sentenced to imprisonment at the pleasure of the court. In this\r\ndifference between the assistants and the deputies, we observe an early\r\nsymptom of that popular revolt against the ascendancy of the clergy\r\nwhich was by and by to become so much more conspicuous and effective\r\nin the affair of the Quakers. Another symptom might be seen in the\r\ncircumstance that so much sympathy was expressed for the Gortonites,\r\nespecially by women, that after some months of imprisonment and abuse\r\nthe heretics were banished under penalty of death. [Sidenote: Trial and\r\nsentence of the heretics]\r\n\r\nGorton now went to England and laid his tale of woe before the\r\nparliamentary Board of Commissioners. The Earl of Warwick behaved with\r\nmoderation. He declined to commit himself to an opinion as to the\r\nmerits of the quarrel, but Gorton\u0027s title to Shawomet was confirmed. He\r\nreturned to Boston with an order to the government to allow him to pass\r\nunmolested through Massachusetts, and hereafter to protect him in\r\nthe possession of Shawomet. If this little commonwealth of 15,000\r\ninhabitants had been a nation as powerful as France, she could not have\r\ntreated the message more haughtily. By a majority of one vote it was\r\ndecided not to refuse so trifling a favour as a passage through the\r\ncountry for just this once; but as for protecting the new town of\r\nWarwick which the Gortonites proceeded to found at Shawomet, although it\r\nwas several times threatened by the Indians, and the settlers appealed\r\nto the parliamentary order, that order Massachusetts flatly and doggedly\r\nrefused to obey. [21] [Sidenote: Gorton appeals to Parliament]\r\n\r\nIn the discussions of which these years were so full, \"King Winthrop,\"\r\nas his enemy Morton called him, used some very significant language. By\r\na curious legal fiction of the Massachusetts charter the colonists were\r\nsupposed to hold their land as in the manor of East Greenwich near\r\nLondon, and it was argued that they were represented in Parliament by\r\nthe members of the county or borough which contained that manor, and\r\nwere accordingly subject to the jurisdiction of Parliament. It was\r\nfurther argued that since the king had no absolute sovereignty\r\nindependent of Parliament he could not by charter impart any such\r\nindependent sovereignty to others. Winthrop did not dispute these\r\npoints, but observed that the safety of the commonwealth was the supreme\r\nlaw, and if in the interests of that safety it should be found necessary\r\nto renounce the authority of Parliament, the colonists would be\r\njustified in doing so. [Sidenote: Winthrop\u0027s prophetic opinion] [22]\r\nThis was essentially the same doctrine as was set forth ninety-nine\r\nyears later by young Samuel Adams in his Commencement Oration at\r\nHarvard.\r\n\r\nThe case of the Presbyterian cabal admits of briefer treatment than that\r\nof Gorton. There had now come to be many persons in Massachusetts who\r\ndisapproved of the provision which restricted the suffrage to members of\r\nthe Independent or Congregational churches of New England, and in 1646\r\nthe views of these people were presented in a petition to the General\r\nCourt. The petitioners asked \"that their civil disabilities might be\r\nremoved, and that all members of the churches of England and Scotland\r\nmight be admitted to communion with the New England churches. If this\r\ncould not be granted they prayed to be released from all civil burdens.\r\nShould the court refuse to entertain their complaint, they would be\r\nobliged to bring their case before Parliament.\" [23] The leading signers\r\nof this menacing petition were William Vassall, Samuel Maverick, and The\r\nPresbyterian cabal. Dr. Robert Child. Maverick we have already met. From\r\nthe day when the ships of the first Puritan settlers had sailed past\r\nhis log fortress on Noddle\u0027s Island, he had been their enemy; \"a man of\r\nloving and curteous behaviour,\" says Johnson, \"very ready to entertaine\r\nstrangers, yet an enemy to the reformation in hand, being strong for the\r\nlordly prelatical power.\" Vassall was not a denizen of Massachusetts,\r\nbut lived in Scituate, in the colony of Plymouth, where there were no\r\nsuch restrictions upon the suffrage. Child was a learned physician who\r\nafter a good deal of roaming about the world had lately taken it into\r\nhis head to come and see what sort of a place Massachusetts was.\r\nAlthough these names were therefore not such as to lend weight to such a\r\npetition, their request would seem at first sight reasonable enough.\r\nAt a superficial glance it seems conceived in a modern spirit of\r\nliberalism. In reality it was nothing of the sort. In England it was\r\njust the critical moment of the struggle between Presbyterians and\r\nIndependents which had come in to complicate the issues of the great\r\ncivil war. Vassall, Child, and Maverick seem to have been the leading\r\nspirits in a cabal for the establishment of Presbyterianism in New\r\nEngland, and in their petition they simply took advantage of the\r\ndiscontent of the disfranchised citizens in Massachusetts in order\r\nto put in an entering wedge. This was thoroughly understood by the\r\nlegislature of Massachusetts, and accordingly the petition was dismissed\r\nand the petitioners were roundly fined. Just as Child was about to start\r\nfor England with his grievances, the magistrates overhauled his papers\r\nand discovered a petition to the parliamentary Board of Commissioners,\r\nsuggesting that Presbyterianism should be established in New England,\r\nand that a viceroy or governor-general should be appointed to rule\r\nthere. To the men of Massachusetts this last suggestion was a crowning\r\nhorror. It seemed scarcely less than treason. The signers of this\r\npetition were the same who had signed the petition to the General Court.\r\nThey were now fined still more heavily and imprisoned for six months.\r\nBy and by they found their way, one after another, to London, while the\r\ncolonists sent Edward Winslow, of Plymouth, as an advocate to thwart\r\ntheir schemes. Winslow was assailed by Child\u0027s brother in a spicy\r\npamphlet entitled \"New England\u0027s Jonas cast up at London,\" and replied\r\nafter the same sort, entitling his pamphlet \"New England\u0027s Salamander\r\ndiscovered.\" The cabal accomplished nothing because of the decisive\r\ndefeat of Presbyterianism in England. \"Pride\u0027s Purge\" settled all that.\r\nThe petition of Vassall and his friends was the occasion for the\r\nmeeting of a synod of churches at Cambridge, in order to complete the\r\norganization of Congregationalism. In 1648 the work of the synod was\r\nembodied in the famous Cambridge Platform, which adopted the Westminster\r\nConfession as its creed, carefully defined the powers of the clergy, and\r\ndeclared it to be the duty of magistrates to suppress heresy. In 1649\r\nthe General Court laid this platform before the congregations; in\r\n1651 it was adopted; and this event may be regarded as completing the\r\ntheocratic organization of the Puritan commonwealth in Massachusetts.\r\n[Sidenote: The Cambridge Platform; deaths of Winthrop and Cotton]\r\n\r\nIt was immediately preceded and followed by the deaths of the two\r\nforemost men in that commonwealth. John Winthrop died in 1649 and John\r\nCotton in 1652. Both were men of extraordinary power. Of Winthrop it is\r\nenough to say that under his skilful guidance Massachusetts had been\r\nable to pursue the daring policy which had characterized the first\r\ntwenty years of her history, and which in weaker hands would almost\r\nsurely have ended in disaster. Of Cotton it may be said that he was the\r\nmost eminent among a group of clergymen who for learning and dialectical\r\nskill have seldom been surpassed. Neither Winthrop nor Cotton approved\r\nof toleration upon principle. Cotton, in his elaborate controversy\r\nwith Roger Williams, frankly asserted that persecution is not wrong in\r\nitself; it is wicked for falsehood to persecute truth, but it is the\r\nsacred duty of truth to persecute falsehood. This was the theologian\u0027s\r\nview. Winthrop\u0027s was that of a man of affairs. They had come to New\r\nEngland, he said, in order to make a society after their own model;\r\nall who agreed with them might come and join that society; those who\r\ndisagreed with them might go elsewhere; there was room enough on the\r\nAmerican continent. But while neither Winthrop nor Cotton understood the\r\nprinciple of religious liberty, at the same time neither of them had the\r\ntemperament which persecutes. Both were men of genial disposition, sound\r\ncommon-sense, and exquisite tact. Under their guidance no such\r\ntragedy would have been possible as that which was about to leave its\r\nineffaceable stain upon the annals of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nIt was most unfortunate that at this moment the places of these two men\r\nshould have been taken by two as arrant fanatics as ever drew breath.\r\nFor thirteen out of the fifteen years following Winthrop\u0027s death, the\r\ngovernor of Massachusetts was John Endicott, a sturdy pioneer, whose\r\nservices to the colony had been great. He was honest and conscientious,\r\nbut passionate, domineering, and very deficient in tact. At the same\r\ntime Cotton\u0027s successor in position and influence was John Norton, a man\r\nof pungent wit, unyielding temper, and melancholy mood. He was possessed\r\nby a morbid fear of Satan, whose hirelings he thought were walking\r\nup and down over the earth in the visible semblance of heretics and\r\nschismatics. Under such leaders the bigotry latent in the Puritan\r\ncommonwealth might easily break out in acts of deadly persecution.\r\n[Sidenote: Endicott and Norton take the lead] [Sidenote: The Quakers and\r\ntheir views]\r\n\r\nThe occasion was not long in coming. Already the preaching of George Fox\r\nhad borne fruit, and the noble sect of Quakers was an object of scorn\r\nand loathing to all such as had not gone so far as they toward learning\r\nthe true lesson of Protestantism. Of all Protestant sects the Quakers\r\nwent furthest in stripping off from Christianity its non-essential\r\nfeatures of doctrine and ceremonial. Their ideal was not a theocracy\r\nbut a separation between church and state. They would abolish all\r\ndistinction between clergy and laity, and could not be coaxed or bullied\r\ninto paying tithes. They also refused to render military service, or\r\nto take the oath of allegiance. In these ways they came at once into\r\nantagonism both with church and with state. In doctrine their chief\r\npeculiarity was the assertion of an \"Inward Light\" by which every\r\nindividual is to be guided in his conduct of life. They did not believe\r\nthat men ceased to be divinely inspired when the apostolic ages came\r\nto an end, but held that at all times and places the human soul may be\r\nenlightened by direct communion with its Heavenly Father. Such views\r\ninvolved the most absolute assertion of the right of private judgment;\r\nand when it is added that in the exercise of this right many Quakers\r\nwere found to reject the dogmas of original sin and the resurrection of\r\nthe body, to doubt the efficacy of baptism, and to call in question the\r\npropriety of Christians turning the Lord\u0027s Day into a Jewish Sabbath, we\r\nsee that they had in some respects gone far on the road toward modern\r\nrationalism. It was not to be expected that such opinions should\r\nbe treated by the Puritans in any other spirit than one of extreme\r\nabhorrence and dread. The doctrine of the \"Inward Light,\" or of private\r\ninspiration, was something especially hateful to the Puritan. To the\r\nmodern rationalist, looking at things in the dry light of history,\r\nit may seem that this doctrine was only the Puritan\u0027s own appeal to\r\nindividual judgment, stated in different form; but the Puritan could not\r\nso regard it. To such a fanatic as Norton this inward light was but\r\na reflection from the glare of the bottomless pit, this private\r\ninspiration was the beguiling voice of the Devil. As it led the Quakers\r\nto strange and novel conclusions, this inward light seemed to array\r\nitself in hostility to that final court of appeal for all good\r\nProtestants, the sacred text of the Bible. The Quakers were accordingly\r\nregarded as infidels who sought to deprive Protestantism of its only\r\nfirm support. They were wrongly accused of blasphemy in their treatment\r\nof the Scriptures. Cotton Mather says that the Quakers were in the habit\r\nof alluding to the Bible as the Word of the Devil. Such charges, from\r\npassionate and uncritical enemies, are worthless except as they serve to\r\nexplain the bitter prejudice with which the Quakers were regarded. They\r\nremind one of the silly accusation brought against Wyclif two centuries\r\nearlier, that he taught his disciples that God ought to obey the Devil;\r\n[24] and they are not altogether unlike the assumptions of some modern\r\ntheologians who take it for granted that any writer who accepts the\r\nDarwinian theory must be a materialist. [Sidenote: Endicott and Norton\r\ntake the lead] [Sidenote: The Quakers and their views]\r\n\r\nBut worthless as Mather\u0027s statements are, in describing the views of\r\nthe Quakers, they are valuable as indicating the temper in which these\r\ndisturbers of the Puritan theocracy were regarded. In accusing them of\r\nrejecting the Bible and making a law unto themselves, Mather simply put\r\non record a general belief which he shared. Nor can it be doubted that\r\nthe demeanour of the Quaker enthusiasts was sometimes such as to seem\r\nto warrant the belief that their anarchical doctrines entailed, as a\r\nnatural consequence, disorderly and disreputable conduct. In those\r\ndays all manifestations of dissent were apt to be violent, and the\r\npersecution which they encountered was likely to call forth strange and\r\nunseemly vagaries. When we remember how the Quakers, in their scorn of\r\nearthly magistrates and princes, would hoot at the governor as he\r\nwalked up the street; how they used to rush into church on Sundays and\r\ninterrupt the sermon with untimely remarks; how Thomas Newhouse once\r\ncame into the Old South Meeting-House with a glass bottle in each hand,\r\nand, holding them up before the astonished congregation, knocked them\r\ntogether and smashed them, with the remark, \"Thus will the Lord break\r\nyou all in pieces\"; how Lydia Wardwell and Deborah Wilson ran about the\r\nstreets in the primitive costume of Eve before the fall, and called\r\ntheir conduct \"testifying before the Lord\"; we can hardly wonder that\r\npeople should have been reminded of the wretched scenes enacted at\r\nMunster by the Anabaptists of the preceding century. [Sidenote: Violent\r\nmanifestations of dissent]\r\n\r\nSuch incidents, however, do not afford the slightest excuse for the\r\ncruel treatment which the Quakers received in Boston, nor do they go\r\nfar toward explaining it. Persecution began immediately, before the\r\nnew-comers had a chance to behave themselves well or ill. Their mere\r\ncoming to Boston was taken as an act of invasion. It was indeed an\r\nattack upon the Puritan theocratic idea. Of all the sectaries of that\r\nage of sects, the Quakers were the most aggressive. There were at one\r\ntime more than four thousand of them in English jails; yet when any of\r\nthem left England, it was less to escape persecution than to preach\r\ntheir doctrines far and wide over the earth. Their missionaries found\r\ntheir way to Paris, to Vienna; even to Rome, where they testified under\r\nthe very roof of the Vatican. In this dauntless spirit they came to New\r\nEngland to convert its inhabitants, or at any rate to establish the\r\nprinciple that in whatever community it might please them to stay, there\r\nthey would stay in spite of judge or hangman. At first they came to\r\nBarbadoes, whence two of their number, Anne Austin and Mary Fisher,\r\nsailed for Boston. When they landed, on a May morning in 1656, Endicott\r\nhappened to be away from Boston, but the deputy-governor, Richard\r\nBellingham, was equal to the occasion. He arrested the two women and\r\nlocked them up in jail, where, for fear they might proclaim their\r\nheresies to the crowd gathered outside, the windows were boarded up.\r\nThere was no law as yet enacted against Quakers, but a council summoned\r\nfor the occasion pronounced their doctrines blasphemous and devilish.\r\nThe books which the poor women had with them were seized and publicly\r\nburned, and the women themselves were kept in prison half-starved for\r\nfive weeks until the ship they had come in was ready to return to\r\nBarbadoes. Soon after their departure Endicott came home. He found fault\r\nwith Bellingham\u0027s conduct as too gentle; if he had been there he would\r\nhave had the hussies flogged. [Sidenote: Anne Austin and Mary Fisher]\r\n\r\nFive years afterward Mary Fisher went to Adrianople and tried to convert\r\nthe Grand Turk, who treated her with grave courtesy and allowed her to\r\nprophesy unmolested. This is one of the numerous incidents that, on a\r\nsuperficial view of history, might be cited in support of the opinion\r\nthat there has been on the whole more tolerance in the Mussulman than in\r\nthe Christian world. Rightly interpreted, however, the fact has no such\r\nimplication. In Massachusetts the preaching of Quaker doctrines might\r\n(and did) lead to a revolution; in Turkey it was as harmless as the\r\nbarking of dogs. Governor Endicott was afraid of Mary Fisher; Mahomet\r\nIII. was not.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the two women been shipped from Boston than eight other\r\nQuakers arrived from London. They were at once arrested. While they were\r\nlying in jail the Federal Commissioners, then in session at Plymouth,\r\nrecommended that laws be forthwith enacted to keep these dreaded\r\nheretics out of the land. Next year they stooped so far as to seek the\r\naid of Rhode Island, the colony which they had refused to admit into\r\ntheir confederacy. \"They sent a letter to the authorities of that\r\ncolony, signing themselves their loving friends and neighbours, and\r\nbeseeching them to preserve the whole body of colonies against \u0027such a\r\npest\u0027 by banishing and excluding all Quakers, a measure to which \u0027the\r\nrule of charity did oblige them.\u0027\" Roger Williams was then president of\r\nRhode Island, and in full accord with his noble spirit was the reply of\r\nthe assembly. \"We have no law amongst us whereby to punish any for only\r\ndeclaring by words their minds and understandings concerning the things\r\nand ways of God as to salvation and our eternal condition.\" As for these\r\nQuakers we find that where they are \"most of all suffered to declare\r\nthemselves freely and only opposed by arguments in discourse, there\r\nthey least of all desire to come.\" Any breach of the civil law shall be\r\npunished, but the \"freedom of different consciences shall be respected.\"\r\nThis reply enraged the confederated colonies, and Massachusetts, as the\r\nstrongest and most overbearing, threatened to cut off the trade of\r\nRhode Island, which forthwith appealed to Cromwell for protection. The\r\nlanguage of the appeal is as touching as its broad Christian spirit is\r\ngrand. It recognizes that by stopping trade the men of Massachusetts\r\nwill injure themselves, yet, it goes on to say, \"for the safeguard of\r\ntheir religion they may seem to neglect themselves in that respect; for\r\nwhat will not men do for their God?\" But whatever fortune may befall,\r\n\"let us not be compelled to exercise any civil power over men\u0027s\r\nconsciences.\" [25] [Sidenote: Noble conduct of Rhode Island]\r\n\r\nThere could never, of course, be a doubt as to who drew up this state\r\npaper. During his last visit to England, three years before, Roger\r\nWilliams had spent several weeks at Sir Harry Vane\u0027s country house in\r\nLincolnshire, and he had also been intimately associated with Cromwell\r\nand Milton. The views of these great men were the most advanced of\r\nthat age. They were coming to understand the true principle upon which\r\ntoleration should be based. (See my Excursions of an Evolutionist, pp.\r\n247, 289-293.) Vane had said in Parliament, \"Why should the labours of\r\nany be suppressed, if sober, though never so different? We now profess\r\nto seek God, we desire to see light!\" [Sidenote: Roger Williams appeals\r\nto Cromwell]\r\n\r\nThis Williams called a \"heavenly speech.\" The sentiment it expressed was\r\nin accordance with the practical policy of Cromwell, and in the appeal\r\nof the president of Rhode Island to the Lord Protector one hears the\r\ntone with which friend speaks to friend.\r\n\r\nIn thus protecting the Quakers, Williams never for a moment concealed\r\nhis antipathy to their doctrines. The author of \"George Fox digged out\r\nof his Burrowes,\" the sturdy controversialist who in his seventy-third\r\nyear rowed himself in a boat the whole length of Narragansett bay to\r\nengage in a theological tournament against three Quaker champions, was\r\nanimated by nothing less than the broadest liberalism in his bold reply\r\nto the Federal Commissioners in 1657. The event showed that under his\r\nguidance the policy of Rhode Island was not only honourable but wise.\r\nThe four confederated colonies all proceeded to pass laws banishing\r\nQuakers and making it a penal offence for shipmasters to bring them to\r\nNew England. These laws differed in severity. Those of Connecticut, in\r\nwhich we may trace the influence of the younger John Winthrop, were the\r\nmildest; those of Massachusetts were the most severe, and as Quakers\r\nkept coming all the more in spite of them, they grew harsher and\r\nharsher. At first the Quaker who persisted in returning was to be\r\nflogged and imprisoned at hard labour, next his ears were to be cut off,\r\nand for a third offence his tongue was to be bored with a hot iron.\r\nAt length in 1658, the Federal Commissioners, sitting at Boston with\r\nEndicott as chairman, recommended capital punishment. It must be borne\r\nin mind that the general reluctance toward prescribing or inflicting the\r\ndeath penalty was much weaker then than now. On the statute-books there\r\nwere not less than fifteen capital crimes, including such offences as\r\nidolatry, witchcraft, blasphemy, marriage within the Levitical degrees,\r\n\"presumptuous sabbath-breaking,\" and cursing or smiting one\u0027s parents.\r\n[26] The infliction of the penalty, however, lay practically very much\r\nwithin the discretion of the court, and was generally avoided except in\r\ncases of murder or other heinous felony. In some of these ecclesiastical\r\noffences the statute seems to have served the purpose of a threat, and\r\nwas therefore perhaps the more easily enacted. Yet none of the colonies\r\nexcept Massachusetts now adopted the suggestion of the Federal\r\nCommissioners and threatened the Quakers with death. [Sidenote: Laws\r\npassed against the Quakers]\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts the opposition was very strong indeed, and its\r\ncharacter shows how wide the divergence in sentiment had already become\r\nbetween the upper stratum of society and the people in general. This\r\ndivergence was one result of the excessive weight given to the clergy by\r\nthe restriction of the suffrage to church members. One might almost say\r\nthat it was not the people of Massachusetts, after all, that shed\r\nthe blood of the Quakers; it was Endicott and the clergy. The bill\r\nestablishing death as the penalty for returning after banishment was\r\npassed in the upper house without serious difficulty; but in the lower\r\nhouse it was at first defeated. Of the twenty-six deputies fifteen were\r\nopposed to it, but one of these fell sick and two were intimidated,\r\nso that finally the infamous measure was passed by a vote of thirteen\r\nagainst twelve. Probably it would not have passed but for a hopeful\r\nfeeling that an occasion for putting it into execution would not\r\nbe likely to arise. It was hoped that the mere threat would prove\r\neffective. Endicott begged the Quakers to keep away, saying earnestly\r\nthat he did not desire their death; but the more resolute spirits\r\nwere not deterred by fear of the gallows. In September, 1659, William\r\nRobinson, Marmaduke Stevenson, and Mary Dyer, who had come to Boston\r\nexpressly to defy the cruel law, were banished. Mrs. Dyer was a lady\r\nof good family, wife of the secretary of Rhode Island. She had been an\r\nintimate friend of Mrs. Hutchinson. While she went home to her husband,\r\nStevenson and Robinson went only to Salem and then faced about and came\r\nback to Boston. Mrs. Dyer also returned. All three felt themselves\r\nunder divine command to resist and defy the persecutors. On the 27th of\r\nOctober they were led to the gallows on Boston Common, under escort of\r\na hundred soldiers. Many people had begun to cry shame on such\r\nproceedings, and it was thought necessary to take precautions against a\r\ntumult. The victims tried to address the crowd, but their voices were\r\ndrowned by the beating of drums. While the Rev. John Wilson railed and\r\nscoffed at them from the foot of the gallows the two brave men were\r\nhanged. The halter had been placed upon Mrs. Dyer when her son, who\r\nhad come in all haste from Rhode Island, obtained her reprieve on\r\nhis promise to take her away. The bodies of the two men were denied\r\nChristian burial and thrown uncovered into a pit. All the efforts of\r\nhusband and son were unable to keep Mrs. Dyer at home. In the following\r\nspring she returned to Boston and on the first day of June was again\r\ntaken to the gallows. At the last moment she was offered freedom if she\r\nwould only promise to go away and stay, but she refused. \"In obedience\r\nto the will of the Lord I came,\" said she, \"and in his will I abide\r\nfaithful unto death.\" And so she died. [Sidenote: Executions on Boston\r\nCommon] [Sidenote: Wenlock Christison\u0027s defiance and victory]\r\n\r\nPublic sentiment in Boston was now turning so strongly against the\r\nmagistrates that they began to weaken in their purpose. But there\r\nwas one more victim. In November, 1660, William Leddra returned from\r\nbanishment. The case was clear enough, but he was kept in prison four\r\nmonths and every effort was made to induce him to promise to leave the\r\ncolony, but in vain. In the following March he too was put to death. A\r\nfew days before the execution, as Leddra was being questioned in court,\r\na memorable scene occurred. Wenlock Christison was one of those who had\r\nbeen banished under penalty of death. On his return he made straight for\r\nthe town-house, strode into the court-room, and with uplifted finger\r\naddressed the judges in words of authority. \"I am come here to warn\r\nyou,\" said he, \"that ye shed no more innocent blood.\" He was instantly\r\nseized and dragged off to jail. After three months he was brought to\r\ntrial before the Court of Assistants. The magistrates debated for more\r\nthan a fortnight as to what should be done. The air was thick with\r\nmutterings of insurrection, and they had lost all heart for their\r\ndreadful work. Not so the savage old man who presided, frowning gloomily\r\nunder his black skull cap. Losing his patience at last, Endicott smote\r\nthe table with fury, upbraided the judges for their weakness, and\r\ndeclared himself so disgusted that he was ready to go back to England.\r\n[27] \"You that will not consent, record it,\" he shouted, as the question\r\nwas again put to vote, \"I thank God I am not afraid to give judgment.\"\r\nChristison was condemned to death, but the sentence was never executed.\r\nIn the interval the legislature assembled, and the law was modified. The\r\nmartyrs had not died in vain. Their cause was victorious. A revolution\r\nhad been effected. The Puritan ideal of a commonwealth composed of a\r\nunited body of believers was broken down, never again to be restored.\r\nThe principle had been admitted that the heretic might come to\r\nMassachusetts and stay there.\r\n\r\nIt was not in a moment, however, that these results were fully realized.\r\nFor some years longer Quakers were fined, imprisoned, and now and then\r\ntied to the cart\u0027s tail and whipped from one town to another. But these\r\nacts of persecution came to be more and more discountenanced by public\r\nopinion until at length they ceased.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 25th of May, 1660, just one week before the martyrdom of\r\nMary Dyer, that Charles II. returned to England to occupy his father\u0027s\r\nthrone. One of the first papers laid before him was a memorial in behalf\r\nof the oppressed Quakers in New England. In the course of the following\r\nyear he sent a letter to Endicott and the other New England governors,\r\nordering them to suspend proceedings against the Quakers, and if any\r\nwere then in prison, to send them to England for trial. Christison\u0027s\r\nvictory had already been won, but the \"King\u0027s Missive\" was now partially\r\nobeyed by the release of all prisoners. As for sending anybody to\r\nEngland for trial, that was something that no New England government\r\ncould ever be made to allow.\r\n\r\nCharles\u0027s defence of the Quakers was due, neither to liberality\r\nof disposition nor to any sympathy with them, but rather to his\r\ninclinations toward Romanism. Unlike in other respects, Quakers and\r\nCatholics were alike in this, that they were the only sects which the\r\nProtestant world in general agreed in excluding from toleration. Charles\r\nwished to secure toleration for Catholics, and he could not prudently\r\ntake steps toward this end without pursuing a policy broad enough to\r\ndiminish persecution in other directions, and from these circumstances\r\nthe Quakers profited. At times there was something almost like a\r\npolitical alliance between Quaker and Catholic, as instanced in the\r\nrelations between William Penn and Charles\u0027s brother, the Duke of York.\r\n[Sidenote: The \"King\u0027s Missive\"] [Sidenote: Why Charles II. interfered\r\nto protect the Quakers]\r\n\r\nBesides all this, Charles had good reason to feel that the governments\r\nof New England were assuming too many airs of sovereignty. There were\r\nplenty of people at hand to work upon his mind. The friends of Gorton\r\nand Child and Vassall were loud with their complaints. Samuel Maverick\r\nswore that the people of New England were all rebels, and he could prove\r\nit. The king was assured that the Confederacy was \"a war combination,\r\nmade by the four colonies when they had a design to throw off their\r\ndependence on England, and for that purpose.\" The enemies of the New\r\nEngland people, while dilating upon the rebellious disposition of\r\nMassachusetts, could also remind the king that for several years that\r\ncolony had been coining and circulating shillings and sixpences with the\r\nname \"Massachusetts\" and a tree on one side, and the name \"New England\"\r\nwith the date on the other. There was no recognition of England upon\r\nthis coinage, which was begun in 1652 and kept up for more than thirty\r\nyears. Such pieces of money used to be called \"pine-tree shillings\";\r\nbut, so far as looks go, the tree might be anything, and an adroit\r\nfriend of New England once gravely assured the king that it was meant\r\nfor the royal oak in which his majesty hid himself after the battle of\r\nWorcester!\r\n\r\nAgainst the colony of New Haven the king had a special grudge. Two of\r\nthe regicide judges, who had sat in the tribunal which condemned his\r\nfather, escaped to New England in 1660 and were well received there.\r\nThey were gentlemen of high position. Edward Whalley was a cousin of\r\nCromwell and Hampden. He had distinguished himself at Naseby and Dunbar,\r\nand had risen to the rank of lieutenant-general. He had commanded at\r\nthe capture of Worcester, where it is interesting to observe that the\r\nroyalist commander who surrendered to him was Sir Henry Washington, own\r\ncousin to the grandfather of George Washington. The other regicide,\r\nWilliam Goffe, as a major-general in Cromwell\u0027s army, had won such\r\ndistinction that there were some who pointed to him as the proper person\r\nto succeed the Lord Protector on the death of the latter. He had married\r\nWhalley\u0027s daughter. Soon after the arrival of these gentlemen, a royal\r\norder for their arrest was sent to Boston. If they had been arrested and\r\nsent back to England, their severed heads would soon have been placed\r\nover Temple Bar. The king\u0027s detectives hotly pursued them through the\r\nwoodland paths of New England, and they would soon have been taken but\r\nfor the aid they got from the people. Many are the stories of their\r\nhairbreadth escapes. Sometimes they took refuge in a cave on a mountain\r\nnear New Haven, sometimes they hid in friendly cellars; and once, being\r\nhard put to it, they skulked under a wooden bridge, while their pursuers\r\non horseback galloped by overhead. After lurking about New Haven and\r\nMilford for two or three years, on hearing of the expected arrival\r\nof Colonel Nichols and his commission, they sought a more secluded\r\nhiding-place near Hadley, a village lately settled far up the\r\nConnecticut river, within the jurisdiction of Massachusetts. Here the\r\navengers lost the trail, the pursuit was abandoned, and the weary\r\nregicides were presently forgotten. The people of New Haven had been\r\nespecially zealous in shielding the fugitives. Mr. Davenport had not\r\nonly harboured them in his own house, but on the Sabbath before their\r\nexpected arrival he had preached a very bold sermon, openly advising\r\nhis people to aid and comfort them as far as possible. [28] The colony,\r\nmoreover, did not officially recognize the restoration of Charles II. to\r\nthe throne until that event had been commonly known in New England for\r\nmore than a year. For these reasons the wrath of the king was specially\r\nroused against New Haven, when circumstances combined to enable him at\r\nonce to punish this disloyal colony and deal a blow at the Confederacy.\r\nWe have seen that in restricting the suffrage to church members New\r\nHaven had followed the example of Massachusetts, but Connecticut had\r\nnot; and at this time there was warm controversy between the two younger\r\ncolonies as to the wisdom Of such a policy. As yet none of the colonies\r\nsave Massachusetts had obtained a charter, and Connecticut was naturally\r\nanxious to obtain one. Whether through a complaisant spirit connected\r\nwith this desire, or through mere accident, Connecticut had been prompt\r\nin acknowledging the restoration of Charles II.; and in August, 1661,\r\nshe dispatched the younger Winthrop to England to apply for a charter.\r\nWinthrop was a man of winning address and of wide culture. His\r\nscientific tastes were a passport to the favour of the king at a time\r\nwhen the Royal Society was being founded, of which Winthrop himself was\r\nsoon chosen a fellow. In every way the occasion was an auspicious one.\r\nThe king looked upon the rise of the New England Confederacy with\r\nunfriendly eyes. Massachusetts was as yet the only member of the league\r\nthat was really troublesome; and there seemed to be no easier way to\r\nweaken her than to raise up a rival power by her side, and extend to it\r\nsuch privileges as might awaken her jealousy. All the more would such\r\na policy be likely to succeed if accompanied by measures of which\r\nMassachusetts must necessarily disapprove, and the suppression of\r\nNew Haven would be such a measure. [Sidenote: New Haven annexed to\r\nConnecticut]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with these views, a charter of great liberality was at\r\nonce granted to Connecticut, and by the same instrument the colony of\r\nNew Haven was deprived of its separate existence and annexed to its\r\nstronger neighbour. As if to emphasize the motives which had led to this\r\ndisplay of royal favour toward Connecticut, an equally liberal charter\r\nwas granted to Rhode Island. In the summer of 1664 Charles II. sent a\r\ncouple of ships-of-war to Boston harbour, with 400 troops under command\r\nof Colonel Richard Nichols, who had been appointed, along with Samuel\r\nMaverick and two others as royal commissioners, to look after the\r\naffairs of the New World. Colonel Nichols took his ships to New\r\nAmsterdam, and captured that important town. After his return the\r\ncommissioners held meetings at Boston, and for a time the Massachusetts\r\ncharter seemed in danger. But the Puritan magistrates were shrewd, and\r\nmonths were frittered away to no purpose. Presently the Dutch made war\r\nupon England, and the king felt it to be unwise to irritate the people\r\nof Massachusetts beyond endurance. The turbulent state of English\r\npolitics which followed still further absorbed his attention, and New\r\nEngland had another respite of several years. [Sidenote: Founding of\r\nNewark]\r\n\r\nIn New Haven a party had grown up which was dissatisfied with its\r\nextreme theocratic policy and approved of the union with Connecticut.\r\nDavenport and his followers, the founders of the colony, were beyond\r\nmeasure disgusted. They spurned \"the Christless rule\" of the sister\r\ncolony. Many of them took advantage of the recent conquest of New\r\nNetherland, and a strong party, led by the Rev. Abraham Pierson, of\r\nBranford, migrated to the banks of the Passaic in June, 1667, and laid\r\nthe foundations of Newark. For some years to come the theocratic idea\r\nthat had given birth to New Haven continued to live on in New Jersey. As\r\nfor Mr. Davenport, he went to Boston and ended his days there. Cotton\r\nMather, writing at a later date, when the theocratic scheme of the early\r\nsettlers had been manifestly outgrown and superseded, says of Davenport:\r\n\"Yet, after all, the Lord gave him to see that in this world a\r\nChurch-State was impossible, whereinto there enters nothing which\r\ndefiles.\"\r\n\r\nThe theocratic policy, alike in New Haven and in Massachusetts, broke\r\ndown largely through its inherent weakness. It divided the community,\r\nand created among the people a party adverse to its arrogance and\r\nexclusiveness. This state of things facilitated the suppression of\r\nNew Haven by royal edict, and it made possible the victory of Wenlock\r\nChristison in Massachusetts. We can now see the fundamental explanation\r\nof the deadly hostility with which Endicott and his party regarded the\r\nQuakers. The latter aimed a fatal blow at the very root of the idea\r\nwhich had brought the Puritans to New England. Once admit these heretics\r\nas citizens, or even as tolerated sojourners, and there was an end of\r\nthe theocratic state consisting of a united body of believers. It was a\r\nlife-and-death struggle, in which no quarter was given; and the Quakers,\r\naided by popular discontent with the theocracy, even more than by the\r\nintervention of the crown, won a decisive victory.\r\n\r\nAs the work of planting New England took place chiefly in the eleven\r\nyears 1629-1640, during which Charles I. contrived to reign without a\r\nparliament, so the prosperous period of the New England Confederacy,\r\n1643-1664, covers the time of the Civil War and the Commonwealth, and\r\njust laps on to the reign of Charles II. By the summary extinction of\r\nthe separate existence of one of its members for the benefit of another,\r\nits vigour was sadly impaired. But its constitution was revised so as\r\nto make it a league of three states instead of four; and the Federal\r\nCommissioners kept on holding their meetings, though less frequently,\r\nuntil the revocation of the Massachusetts charter in 1684. During\r\nthis period a great Indian war occurred, in the course of which this\r\nconcentration of the military strength of New England, imperfect as it\r\nwas, proved itself very useful. In the history of New England, from the\r\nrestoration of the Stuarts until their final expulsion, the two most\r\nimportant facts are the military struggle of the newly founded states\r\nwith the Indians, and their constitutional struggle against the British\r\ngovernment. The troubles and dangers of 1636 were renewed on a much more\r\nformidable scale, but the strength of the people had waxed greatly in\r\nthe mean time, and the new perils were boldly overcome or skilfully\r\nwarded off; not, however, until the constitution of Massachusetts had\r\nbeen violently wrenched out of shape in the struggle, and seeds of\r\nconflict sown which in the following century were to bear fruit in the\r\nAmerican Revolution. [Sidenote: Breaking down of the theocratic policy]\r\n[Sidenote: Weakening of the Confederacy]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nKING PHILIP\u0027S WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor eight-and-thirty years after the destruction of the Pequots, the\r\nintercourse between the English and the Indians was to all outward\r\nappearance friendly. The policy pursued by the settlers was in the\r\nmain well considered. While they had shown that they could strike with\r\nterrible force when blows were needed, their treatment of the natives in\r\ntime of peace seems to have been generally just and kind. Except in the\r\nsingle case of the conquered Pequot territory, they scrupulously paid\r\nfor every rood of ground on which they settled, and so far as possible\r\nthey extended to the Indians the protection of the law. On these points\r\nwe have the explicit testimony of Josiah Winslow, governor of Plymouth,\r\nin his report to the Federal Commissioners in May, 1676; and what\r\nhe says about Plymouth seems to have been equally true of the other\r\ncolonies. Says Winslow, \"I think I can clearly say that before these\r\npresent troubles broke out, the English did not possess one foot of land\r\nin this colony but what was fairly obtained by honest purchase of the\r\nIndian proprietors. Nay, because some of our people are of a covetous\r\ndisposition, and the Indians are in their straits easily prevailed with\r\nto part with their lands, we first made a law that none should purchase\r\nor receive of gift any land of the Indians without the knowledge and\r\nallowance of our Court .... And if at any time they have brought\r\ncomplaints before us, they have had justice impartial and speedy, so\r\nthat our own people have frequently complained that we erred on the\r\nother hand in showing them overmuch favour.\" The general laws of\r\nMassachusetts and Connecticut as well as of Plymouth bear out what\r\nWinslow says, and show us that as a matter of policy the colonial\r\ngovernments were fully sensible of the importance of avoiding all\r\noccasions for quarrel with their savage neighbours. [Sidenote: Puritans\r\nand Indians]\r\n\r\nThere can, moreover, be little doubt that the material comfort of the\r\nIndians was for a time considerably improved by their dealings with the\r\nwhite men. Hitherto their want of foresight and thrift had been wont to\r\ninvolve them during the long winters in a dreadful struggle with famine.\r\nNow the settlers were ready to pay liberally for the skin of every\r\nfur-covered animal the red men could catch; and where the trade thus\r\narising did not suffice to keep off famine, instances of generous\r\ncharity were frequent. The Algonquin tribes of New England lived chiefly\r\nby hunting, but partly by agriculture. They raised beans and corn, and\r\nsuccotash was a dish which they contributed to the white man\u0027s table.\r\nThey could now raise or buy English vegetables, while from dogs and\r\nhorses, pigs and poultry, oxen and sheep, little as they could avail\r\nthemselves of such useful animals, they nevertheless derived some\r\nbenefit. [29] Better blankets and better knives were brought within\r\ntheir reach; and in spite of all the colonial governments could do to\r\nprevent it, they were to some extent enabled to supply themselves with\r\nmuskets and rum. [Sidenote: Trade with the Indians]\r\n\r\nBesides all this trade, which, except in the article of liquor, tended\r\nto improve the condition of the native tribes, there was on the part of\r\nthe earlier settlers an earnest and diligent effort to convert them\r\nto Christianity and give them the rudiments of a civilized education.\r\nMissionary work was begun in 1643 by Thomas Mayhew on the islands of\r\nNantucket and Martha\u0027s Vineyard. The savages at first declared they were\r\nnot so silly as to barter thirty-seven tutelar deities for one, but\r\nafter much preaching and many pow-wows Mayhew succeeded in persuading\r\nthem that the Deity of the white man was mightier than all their\r\n_manitous._ Whether they ever got much farther than this toward a\r\ncomprehension of the white man\u0027s religion may be doubted; but they were\r\nprevailed upon to let their children learn to read and write, and even\r\nto set up little courts, in which justice was administered according to\r\nsome of the simplest rules of English law, and from which there lay an\r\nappeal to the court of Plymouth. In 1646 Massachusetts enacted that the\r\nelders of the churches should choose two persons each year to go and\r\nspread the gospel among the Indians. In 1649 Parliament established the\r\nSociety for propagating the Gospel in New England, and presently from\r\nvoluntary contributions the society was able to dispose of an annual\r\nincome of £2000. Schools were set up in which agriculture was taught as\r\nwell as religion. It was even intended that Indians should go to Harvard\r\nCollege, and a building was erected for their accommodation, but as none\r\ncame to occupy it, the college printing-press was presently set to work\r\nthere. One solitary Indian student afterward succeeded in climbing to\r\nthe bachelor\u0027s degree,--Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck of the class of 1665. It\r\nwas this one success that was marvellous, not the failure of the scheme,\r\nwhich vividly shows how difficult it was for the white man of that day\r\nto understand the limitations of the red man. [Sidenote: Missionary\r\nwork: Thomas Mayhew]\r\n\r\nThe greatest measure of success in converting the Indians was attained\r\nby that famous linguist and preacher, the apostle John Eliot. This\r\nremarkable man was a graduate of Jesus College, Cambridge. He had come\r\nto Massachusetts in 1631, and in the following year had been settled as\r\nteacher in the church at Roxbury of which Thomas Welde was pastor. He\r\nhad been distinguished at the university for philological scholarship\r\nand for linguistic talent--two things not always found in\r\nconnection--and now during fourteen years he devoted such time as he\r\ncould to acquiring a complete mastery of the Algonquin dialect spoken by\r\nthe Indians of Massachusetts bay. To the modern comparative philologist\r\nhis work is of great value. He published not only an excellent Indian\r\ngrammar, but a complete translation of the Bible into the Massachusetts\r\nlanguage,--a monument of prodigious labour. It is one of the most\r\ninstructive documents in existence for the student of Algonquin speech,\r\nthough the Massachusetts tribe and its language have long been extinct,\r\nand there are very few scholars living who can read the book. It has\r\nbecome one of the curiosities of literature and at auction sales of\r\nprivate libraries commands an extremely high price. Yet out of this rare\r\nbook the American public has somehow or other within the last five\r\nor six years contrived to pick up a word which we shall very likely\r\ncontinue to hear for some time to come. In Eliot\u0027s Bible, the word which\r\nmeans a great chief--such as Joshua, or Gideon, or Joab--is \"mugwump.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in 1646 that Eliot began his missionary preaching at a small\r\nIndian village near Watertown. President Dunster, of Harvard College,\r\nand Mr. Shepard, the minister at Cambridge, felt a warm interest in the\r\nundertaking. These worthy men seriously believed that the aborigines\r\nof America were the degenerate descendants of the ten lost tribes of\r\nIsrael, and from this strange backsliding it was hoped that they might\r\nnow be reclaimed. With rare eloquence and skill did Eliot devote himself\r\nto the difficult work of reaching the Indian\u0027s scanty intelligence and\r\nstill scantier moral sense. His ministrations reached from the sands of\r\nCape Cod to the rocky hillsides of Brookfield. But he soon found that\r\nsingle-handed he could achieve but little over so wide an area, and\r\naccordingly he adopted the policy of colonizing his converts in village\r\ncommunities near the English towns, where they might be sequestered from\r\ntheir heathen brethren and subjected to none but Christian influences.\r\nIn these communities he hoped to train up native missionaries who might\r\nthence go and labour among the wild tribes until the whole lump of\r\nbarbarism should be leavened. In pursuance of this scheme a stockaded\r\nvillage was built at Natick in 1651 Under the direction of an English\r\ncarpenter the Indians built log-houses for themselves, and most of them\r\nadopted the English dress. Their simple government was administered by\r\ntithing-men, or \"rulers of tens,\" chosen after methods prescribed in the\r\nbook of Exodus. Other such communities were formed in the neighbourhoods\r\nof Concord and Grafton. By 1674 the number of these \"praying Indians,\"\r\nas they were called, was estimated at 4000, of whom about 1500 were in\r\nEliot\u0027s villages, as many more in Martha\u0027s Vineyard, 300 in Nantucket,\r\nand 700 in the Plymouth colony. There seems to be no doubt that these\r\nIndians were really benefited both materially and morally by the change\r\nin their life. In theology it is not likely that they reached any higher\r\nview than that expressed by the Connecticut sachem Wequash who \"seeing\r\nand beholding the mighty power of God in the English forces, how they\r\nfell upon the Pequots, ... from that time was convinced and persuaded\r\nthat our God was a most dreadful God;\" accordingly, says the author of\r\n\"New England\u0027s First Fruits,\" \"he became thoroughly reformed according\r\nto his light.\" Matters of outward observance, too, the Indians could\r\nunderstand; for we read of one of them rebuking an Englishman \"for\r\nprofaning the Lord\u0027s Day by felling of a tree.\" The Indian\u0027s notions of\r\nreligion were probably confined within this narrow compass; the notions\r\nof some people that call themselves civilized perhaps do not extend much\r\nfurther. [Sidenote: Villages of Christian Indians]\r\n\r\nFrom such facts as those above cited we may infer that the early\r\nrelations of the Puritan settlers to the Algonquin tribes of New England\r\nwere by no means like the relations between white men and red men in\r\nrecent times on our western plains. During Philip\u0027s War, as we shall\r\nsee, the Puritan theory of the situation was entirely changed and our\r\nforefathers began to act in accordance with the frontiersman\u0027s doctrine\r\nthat the good Indians are dead Indians. But down to that time it is\r\nclear that his intention was to deal honourably and gently with his\r\ntawny neighbour. We sometimes hear the justice and kindness of the\r\nQuakers in Pennsylvania alleged as an adequate reason for the success\r\nwith which they kept clear of an Indian war. This explanation, however,\r\ndoes not seem to be adequate; it does not appear that, on the whole, the\r\nPuritans were less just and kind than the Quakers in their treatment of\r\nthe red men. The true explanation is rather to be found in the relations\r\nbetween the Indian tribes toward the close of the seventeenth century.\r\nEarly in that century the Pennsylvania region had been in the hands\r\nof the ferocious and powerful Susquehannocks, but in 1672, after a\r\nfrightful struggle of twenty years, this great tribe was swept from the\r\nface of the earth by the resistless league of the Five Nations. When\r\nthe Quakers came to Pennsylvania in 1682, the only Indians in that\r\nneighbourhood were the Delawares, who had just been terribly beaten by\r\nthe Five Nations and forced into a treaty by which they submitted to be\r\ncalled \"women,\" and to surrender their tomahawks. Penn\u0027s famous treaty\r\nwas made with the Delawares as occupants of the land and also with the\r\nIroquois league as overlords. [30] Now the great central fact of early\r\nAmerican history, so far as the relations between white men and red\r\nmen are concerned, is the unshaken friendship of the Iroquois for the\r\nEnglish. This was the natural consequence of the deadly hostility\r\nbetween the Iroquois and the French which began with Champlain\u0027s defeat\r\nof the Mohawks in 1609. During the seventy-three years which intervened\r\nbetween the founding of Pennsylvania and the defeat of Braddock there\r\nwas never a moment when the Delawares could have attacked the Quakers\r\nwithout incurring the wrath and vengeance of their overlords the Five\r\nNations. This was the reason why Pennsylvania was left so long in quiet.\r\nNo better proof could be desired than the fact that in Pontiac\u0027s war,\r\nafter the overthrow of the French and when Indian politics had changed,\r\nno state suffered so much as Pennsylvania from the horrors of Indian\r\nwarfare. [Sidenote: Why Pennsylvania was so long unmolested by the\r\nIndians]\r\n\r\nIn New England at the time of Philip\u0027s War, the situation was very\r\ndifferent from what it was between the Hudson and the Susquehanna. The\r\nsettlers were thrown into immediate relations with several tribes whose\r\nmutual hostility and rivalry was such that it was simply impossible to\r\nkeep on good terms with all at once. Such complicated questions as that\r\nwhich involved the English in responsibility for the fate of Miantonomo\r\ndid not arise in Pennsylvania. Since the destruction of the Pequots we\r\nhave observed the Narragansetts and Mohegans contending for the foremost\r\nplace among New England tribes. Of the two rivals the Mohegans were\r\nthe weaker, and therefore courted the friendship of the formidable\r\npalefaces. The English had no desire to take part in these barbarous\r\nfeuds, but they could not treat the Mohegans well without incurring the\r\nhostility of the Narragansetts. For thirty years the feeling of the\r\nlatter tribe toward the English had been very unfriendly and would\r\ndoubtless have vented itself in murder but for their recollection of\r\nthe fate of the Pequots. After the loss of their chief Miantonomo their\r\nattitude became so sullen and defiant that the Federal Commissioners, in\r\norder to be in readiness for an outbreak, collected a force of 300 men.\r\nAt the first news of these preparations the Narragansetts, overcome with\r\nterror, sent a liberal tribute of wampum to Boston, and were fain to\r\nconclude a treaty in which they promised to behave themselves well in\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible that this sort of English protectorate over the native\r\ntribes, which was an inevitable result of the situation, should be other\r\nthan irksome and irritating to the Indians. They could not but see that\r\nthe white man stood there as master, and even in the utter absence\r\nof provocation, this fact alone must have made them hate him. It is\r\ndifficult, moreover, for the civilized man and the savage to understand\r\neach other. As a rule the one does not know what the other is thinking\r\nabout. When Mr. Hamilton Gushing a few years ago took some of his Zuni\r\nfriends into a hotel in Chicago, they marvelled at his entering such a\r\nmighty palace with so little ceremony, and their wonder was heightened\r\nat the promptness with which \"slaves\" came running at his beck and call;\r\nbut all at once, on seeing an American eagle over one of the doorways,\r\nthey felt that the mystery was solved. Evidently this palace was the\r\ncommunal dwelling of the Eagle Clan of palefaces, and evidently Mr.\r\nGushing was a great sachem of this clan, and as such entitled to lordly\r\nsway there! The Zunis are not savages, but representatives of a remote\r\nand primitive phase of what Mr. Morgan calls the middle status of\r\nbarbarism. The gulf between their thinking and that of white men is\r\nwide because there is a wide gulf between the experience of the two.\r\n[Sidenote: Difficulty of the situation in New England] [Sidenote: It is\r\nhard for the savage and the civilized man to understand one another]\r\n\r\nThis illustration may help us to understand an instance in which the\r\nIndians of New England must inevitably have misinterpreted the actions\r\nof the white settlers and read them in the light of their uneasy fears\r\nand prejudices. I refer to the work of the apostle Eliot. His design in\r\nfounding his villages of Christian Indians was in the highest degree\r\nbenevolent and noble; but the heathen Indians could hardly be expected\r\nto see anything in it but a cunning scheme for destroying them.\r\n\r\nEliot\u0027s converts were for the most part from the Massachusetts tribe,\r\nthe smallest and weakest of all. The Plymouth converts came chiefly\r\nfrom the tribe next in weakness, the Pokanokets or Wampanoags. The more\r\npowerful tribes--Narragansetts, Nipmucks, and Mohegans--furnished very\r\nfew converts. When they saw the white intruders gathering members of the\r\nweakest tribes into villages of English type, and teaching them strange\r\ngods while clothing them in strange garments, they probably supposed\r\nthat the pale-faces were simply adopting these Indians into their white\r\ntribe as a means of increasing their military strength. At any rate,\r\nsuch a proceeding would be perfectly intelligible to the savage mind,\r\nwhereas the nature of Eliot\u0027s design lay quite beyond its ken. As the\r\nIndians recovered from their supernatural dread of the English, and\r\nbegan to regard them as using human means to accomplish their ends,\r\nthey must of course interpret their conduct in such light as savage\r\nexperience could afford. It is one of the commonest things in the world\r\nfor a savage tribe to absorb weak neighbours by adoption, and thus\r\nincrease its force preparatory to a deadly assault upon other\r\nneighbours. When Eliot in 1657 preached to the little tribe of Podunks\r\nnear Hartford, and asked them if they were willing to accept of Jesus\r\nChrist as their saviour, their old men scornfully answered No! they had\r\nparted with most of their land, but they were not going to become the\r\nwhite man\u0027s servants. A rebuke administered to Eliot by Uncas in 1674\r\nhas a similar implication. When the apostle was preaching one evening in\r\na village over which that sachem claimed jurisdiction, an Indian arose\r\nand announced himself as a deputy of Uncas. Then he said, \"Uncas is not\r\nwell pleased that the English should pass over Mohegan river to call\r\n_his_ Indians to pray to God.\" [31]\r\n\r\nThus, no matter how benevolent the white man\u0027s intentions, he could not\r\nfail to be dreaded by the Indians as a powerful and ever encroaching\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nEven in his efforts to keep the peace and prevent tribes from taking the\r\nwarpath without his permission, he was interfering with the red man\u0027s\r\ncherished pastime of murder and pillage. The appeals to the court at\r\nPlymouth, the frequent summoning of sachems to Boston, to explain\r\ntheir affairs and justify themselves against accusers, must have been\r\nmaddening in their effects upon the Indian; for there is one sound\r\ninstinct which the savage has in common with the most progressive\r\nraces, and that is the love of self-government that resents all outside\r\ninterference. All things considered, it is remarkable that peace should\r\nhave been maintained in New England from 1637 to 1675; and probably\r\nnothing short of the consuming vengeance wrought upon the Pequots could\r\nhave done it. But with the lapse of time the wholesome feeling of dread\r\nbegan to fade away, and as the Indians came to use musket instead of bow\r\nand arrow, their fear of the English grew less, until at length their\r\nferocious temper broke forth in an epidemic of fire and slaughter that\r\nlaid waste the land. [Sidenote: It is remarkable that peace should have\r\nbeen so long preserved]\r\n\r\nMassasoit, chief sachem of the Wampanoags and steadfast ally of the\r\nPlymouth colonists, died in 1660, leaving two sons, Wamsutta and\r\nMetacom, or as the English nicknamed them, Alexander and Philip.\r\nAlexander succeeded to his father\u0027s position of savage dignity and\r\ninfluence, but his reign was brief. Rumours came to Plymouth that he was\r\nplotting mischief, and he was accordingly summoned to appear before the\r\nGeneral Court of that colony and explain himself. He seems to have gone\r\nreluctantly, but he succeeded in satisfying the magistrates of his\r\ninnocence of any evil designs. Whether he caught cold at Plymouth or\r\ndrank rum as only Indians can, we do not know. At any rate, on starting\r\nhomeward, before he had got clear of English territory, he was seized by\r\na violent fever and died. The savage mind knows nothing of pneumonia or\r\ndelirium tremens. It knows nothing of what we call natural death. To\r\nthe savage all death means murder, for like other men he judges of the\r\nunknown by the known. In the Indian\u0027s experience normal death was by\r\ntomahawk or firebrand; abnormal death (such as we call natural)\r\nmust come either from poison or from witchcraft. So when the honest\r\nchronicler Hubbard tells us that Philip suspected the Plymouth people of\r\npoisoning his brother, we can easily believe him. It was long, however,\r\nbefore he was ready to taste the sweets of revenge. He schemed and\r\nplotted in the dark. In one respect the Indian diplomatist is unlike his\r\nwhite brethren; he does not leave state-papers behind him to reward\r\nthe diligence and gratify the curiosity of later generations; and\r\naccordingly it is hard to tell how far Philip was personally responsible\r\nfor the storm which was presently to burst upon New England. [Sidenote:\r\nDeaths of Massasoit and Alexander] [Sidenote: Philip\u0027s designs]\r\n\r\nWhether his scheme was as comprehensive as that of Pontiac in 1763,\r\nwhether or not it amounted to a deliberate combination of all red men\r\nwithin reach to exterminate the white men, one can hardly say with\r\nconfidence. The figure of Philip, in the war which bears his name, does\r\nnot stand out so prominently as the figure of Pontiac in the later\r\nstruggle. This may be partly because Pontiac\u0027s story has been told by\r\nsuch a magician as Mr. Francis Parkman. But it is partly because the\r\ndata are too meagre. In all probability, however, the schemes of\r\nSassacus the Pequot, of Philip the Wampanoag, and of Pontiac the Ottawa,\r\nwere substantially the same. That Philip plotted with the Narragansetts\r\nseems certain, and the early events of the war point clearly to a\r\nprevious understanding with the Nipmucks. The Mohegans, on the other\r\nhand, gave him no assistance, but remained faithful to their white\r\nallies.\r\n\r\nFor thirteen years had Philip been chief sachem of his tribe before the\r\ncrisis came. Rumours of his unfriendly disposition had at intervals\r\nfound their way to the ears of the magistrates at Plymouth, but Philip\r\nhad succeeded in setting himself right before them. In 1670 the rumours\r\nwere renewed, and the Plymouth men felt that it was time to strike, but\r\nthe other colonies held them back, and a meeting was arranged between\r\nPhilip and three Boston men at Taunton in April, 1671. There the crafty\r\nsavage expressed humility and contrition for all past offences, and\r\neven consented to a treaty in which he promised that his tribe should\r\nsurrender all their fire-arms. On the part of the English this was an\r\nextremely unwise measure, for while it could not possibly be enforced,\r\nand while it must have greatly increased the irritation of the Indians,\r\nit was at the same time interpretable as a symptom of fear. With ominous\r\nscowls and grunts some seventy muskets were given up, but this was all.\r\nThrough the summer there was much uneasiness, and in September Philip\r\nwas summoned to Plymouth with five of his under-sachems, and solemnly\r\nwarned to keep the peace. The savages again behaved with humility and\r\nagreed to pay a yearly tribute of five wolves\u0027 heads and to do no act of\r\nwar without express permission.\r\n\r\nFor three years things seemed quiet, until late in 1674 the alarm was\r\nagain sounded. Sausamon, a convert from the Massachusetts tribe, had\r\nstudied a little at Harvard College, and could speak and write English\r\nwith facility. He had at one time been employed by Philip as a sort of\r\nprivate secretary or messenger, and at other times had preached and\r\ntaught school among the Indian converts at Natick. Sausamon now came to\r\nPlymouth and informed Governor Winslow that Philip was certainly engaged\r\nin a conspiracy that boded no good to the English. Somehow or other\r\nPhilip contrived to find out what Sausamon had said, and presently\r\ncoming to Plymouth loudly asseverated his innocence; but the magistrates\r\nwarned him that if they heard any more of this sort of thing his\r\narms would surely be seized. A few days after Philip had gone home,\r\nSausamon\u0027s hat and gun were seen lying on the frozen surface of\r\nAssowamsett Pond, near Middleborough, and on cutting through the ice his\r\nbody was found with unmistakable marks of beating and strangling. After\r\nsome months the crime was traced to three Wampanoags, who were forthwith\r\narrested, tried by a mixed jury of Indians and white men, found guilty,\r\nand put to death. On the way to the gallows one of them confessed\r\nthat he had stood by while his two friends had pounded and choked the\r\nunfortunate Sausamon. [Sidenote: Murder of Sausamon]\r\n\r\nMore alarming reports now came from Swanzey, a pretty village of some\r\nforty houses not far from Philip\u0027s headquarters at Mount Hope. On Sunday\r\nJune 20, while everybody was at church, a party of Indians had stolen\r\ninto the town and set fire to two houses. Messengers were hurried from\r\nPlymouth and from Boston, to demand the culprits under penalty of\r\ninstant war. As they approached Swanzey the men from Boston saw a sight\r\nthat filled them with horror. The road was strewn with corpses of men,\r\nwomen, and children, scorched, dismembered, and mangled with that\r\ndevilish art of which the American Indian is the most finished master.\r\nThe savages had sacked the village the day before, burning the houses\r\nand slaying the people. Within three days a small force of colonial\r\ntroops had driven Philip from his position at Mount Hope; but while\r\nthey were doing this a party of savages swooped upon Dartmouth, burning\r\nthirty houses and committing fearful atrocities. Some of their victims\r\nwere flayed alive, or impaled on sharp stakes, or roasted over slow\r\nfires. Similar horrors were wrought at Middleborough and Taunton; and\r\nnow the misery spread to Massachusetts, where on the 14th of July the\r\ntown of Mendon was attacked by a party of Nipmucks. [Sidenote: Massacres\r\nat Swanzey and Dartmouth, June, 1675]\r\n\r\nAt that time the beautiful highlands between Lancaster and the\r\nConnecticut river were still an untrodden wilderness. On their southern\r\nslope Worcester and Brookfield were tiny hamlets of a dozen houses each.\r\nUp the Connecticut valley a line of little villages, from Springfield\r\nto Northfield, formed the remotest frontier of the English, and their\r\nexposed position offered tempting opportunities to the Indians. Governor\r\nLeverett saw how great the danger would be if the other tribes should\r\nfollow the example set by Philip, and Captain Edward Hutchinson was\r\naccordingly sent to Brookfield to negotiate with the Nipmucks. This\r\nofficer was eldest son of the unfortunate lady whose preaching in Boston\r\nnearly forty years before had been the occasion of so much strife. Not\r\nonly his mother, but all save one or two of his brothers and sisters\r\n--and there were not less than twelve of them--had been murdered by\r\nIndians on the New Netherland border in 1643; now the same cruel fate\r\novertook the gallant captain. The savages agreed to hold a parley and\r\nappointed a time and place for the purpose, but instead of keeping tryst\r\nthey lay in ambush and slew Hutchinson with eight of his men on their\r\nway to the conference. [Sidenote: Murder of Captain Hutchinson]\r\n\r\nThree days afterward Philip, who had found home too hot for him, arrived\r\nin the Nipmuck country, and on the night of August 2, took part in a\r\nfierce assault on Brookfield. Thirty or forty men, with some fifty women\r\nand children--all the inhabitants of the hamlet--took refuge in a large\r\nhouse, where they were besieged by 300 savages whose bullets pierced the\r\nwooden walls again and again. Arrows tipped with burning rags were\r\nshot into the air in such wise as to fall upon the roof, but they who\r\ncrouched in the garret were watchful and well supplied with water, while\r\nfrom the overhanging windows the volleys of musketry were so brisk and\r\nsteady that the screaming savages below could not get near enough to the\r\nhouse to set it on fire. For three days the fight was kept up, while\r\nevery other house in the village was destroyed. By this time the Indians\r\nhad contrived to mount some planks on barrels so as to make a kind of\r\nrude cart which they loaded with tow and chips. They were just about\r\nsetting it on fire and preparing to push it against the house with long\r\npoles, when they were suddenly foiled by a heavy shower. That noon the\r\ngallant Simon Willard, ancestor of two presidents of Harvard College, a\r\nman who had done so much toward building up Concord and Lancaster that\r\nhe was known as the \"founder of towns,\" was on his way from Lancaster to\r\nGroton at the head of forty-seven horsemen, when he was overtaken by a\r\ncourier with the news from Brookfield. The distance was thirty miles,\r\nthe road scarcely fit to be called a bridle-path, and Willard\u0027s years\r\nwere more than threescore-and-ten; but by an hour after sunset he had\r\ngallopped into Brookfield and routed the Indians who fled to a swamp ten\r\nmiles distant. [Sidenote: Attack on Brookfield]\r\n\r\nThe scene is now shifted to the Connecticut valley, where on the 25th of\r\nAugust Captain Lothrop defeated the savages at Hatfield. On the 1st of\r\nSeptember simultaneous attacks were made upon Deerfield and Hadley, and\r\namong the traditions of the latter place is one of the most interesting\r\nof the stories of that early time. The inhabitants were all in church\r\nkeeping a fast, when the yells of the Indians resounded. Seizing their\r\nguns, the men rushed out to meet the foe; but seeing the village green\r\nswarming on every side with the horrid savages, for a moment their\r\ncourage gave way and a panic was imminent; when all at once a stranger\r\nof reverend aspect and stately form, with white beard flowing on his\r\nbosom, appeared among them and took command with an air of authority\r\nwhich none could gainsay. He bade them charge on the screeching rabble,\r\nand after a short sharp skirmish the tawny foe was put to flight. When\r\nthe pursuers came together again, after the excitement of the rout,\r\ntheir deliverer was not to be found. In their wonder, as they knew not\r\nwhence he came or whither he had gone, many were heard to say that\r\nan angel had been sent from heaven for their deliverance. It was the\r\nregicide William Goffe, who from his hiding-place had seen the savages\r\nstealing down the hillside, and sallied forth to win yet one more\r\nvictory over the hosts of Midian ere death should come to claim him in\r\nhis woodland retreat. Sir Walter Scott has put this pretty story into\r\nthe mouth of Major Bridgenorth in \"Peveril of the Peak,\" and Cooper has\r\nmade use of it in \"The Wept of Wish-ton-wish.\" Like many other romantic\r\nstories, it rests upon insufficient authority and its truth has been\r\ncalled in question. [32] But there seems to be nothing intrinsically\r\nimprobable in the tradition; and a paramount regard for Goffe\u0027s personal\r\nsafety would quite account for the studied silence of contemporary\r\nwriters like Hubbard and Increase Mather. [Sidenote: The mysterious\r\nstranger of Hadley]\r\n\r\nThis repulse did not check for a moment the activity of the Indians,\r\nthough for a long time we hear nothing more of Philip. On the 2d\r\nof September they slew eight men at Northfield and on the 4th they\r\nsurrounded and butchered Captain Beers and most of his company of\r\nthirty-six marching to the relief of that village. The next day but\r\none, as Major Robert Treat came up the road with his 100 Connecticut\r\nsoldiers, they found long poles planted by the wayside bearing the heads\r\nof their unfortunate comrades. They in turn were assaulted, but beat off\r\nthe enemy, and brought away the people of Northfield. That village was\r\nabandoned, and presently Deerfield shared its fate and the people were\r\ncrowded into Hadley. Yet worse remained to be seen. A large quantity of\r\nwheat had been left partly threshed at Deerfield, and on the 11th of\r\nSeptember eighteen wagons were sent up with teamsters and farmers to\r\nfinish the threshing and bring in the grain. They were escorted by\r\nCaptain Lothrop, with his train-band of ninety picked men, known as the\r\n\"Flower of Essex,\" perhaps the best drilled company in the colony. The\r\nthreshing was done, the wagons were loaded, and the party made a night\r\nmarch southward. At seven in the morning, as they were fording a shallow\r\nstream in the shade of overarching woods, they were suddenly overwhelmed\r\nby the deadly fire of 700 ambushed Nipmucks, and only eight of them\r\nescaped to tell the tale. A \"black and fatal\" day was this, says the\r\nchronicler, \"the saddest that ever befell New England.\" To this day the\r\nmemory of the slaughter at Bloody Brook survives, and the visitor to\r\nSouth Deerfield may read the inscription over the grave in which Major\r\nTreat\u0027s men next day buried all the victims together. The Indians now\r\nbegan to feel their power, and on the 5th of October they attacked\r\nSpringfield and burned thirty houses there. [Sidenote: Ambuscade at\r\nBloody Brook, September 12]\r\n\r\nThings were becoming desperate. For ten weeks, from September 9 to\r\nNovember 19, the Federal Commissioners were in session daily in Boston.\r\nThe most eminent of their number, for ability and character, was the\r\nyounger John Winthrop, who was still governor of Connecticut. Plymouth\r\nwas represented by its governor, Josiah Winslow, with the younger\r\nWilliam Bradford; Massachusetts by William Stoughton, Simon Bradstreet,\r\nand Thomas Danforth. These strong men were confronted with a difficult\r\nproblem. From Batten\u0027s journal, kept during that disastrous summer, we\r\nlearn the state of feeling of excitement in Boston. The Puritans had\r\nby no means got rid of that sense of corporate responsibility which\r\ncivilized man has inherited from prehistoric ages, and which has been\r\none of the principal causes of religious persecution. This sombre\r\nfeeling has prompted men to believe that to spare the heretic is to\r\nbring down the wrath of God upon the whole community; and now in Boston\r\nmany people stoutly maintained that God had let loose the savages, with\r\nfirebrand and tomahawk, to punish the people of New England for ceasing\r\nto persecute \"false worshippers and especially idolatrous Quakers.\"\r\nQuaker meetings were accordingly forbidden under penalty of fine and\r\nimprisonment. Some harmless Indians were murdered. At Marblehead two\r\nwere assaulted and killed by a crowd of women. There was a bitter\r\nfeeling toward the Christian Indians, many of whom had joined their\r\nheathen kinsmen in burning and slaying. Daniel Gookin, superintendent of\r\nthe \"praying Indians,\" a gentleman of the highest character, was told\r\nthat it would not be safe to show himself in the streets of Boston.\r\nMrs. Mary Pray, of Providence, wrote a letter recommending the total\r\nextermination of the red men.\r\n\r\nThe measures adopted by the Commissioners certainly went far toward\r\ncarrying out Mrs. Pray\u0027s suggestion. The demeanour of the Narragansetts\r\nhad become very threatening, and their capacity for mischief exceeded\r\nthat of all the other tribes together. In July the Commissioners had\r\nmade a treaty with them, but in October it became known in Boston\r\nthat they were harbouring some of Philip\u0027s hostile Indians. When the\r\nCommissioners sharply called them to account for this, their sachem\r\nCanonchet, son of Miantonomo, promised to surrender the fugitives\r\nwithin ten days. But the ten days passed and nothing was heard from the\r\nNarragansetts. The victory of their brethren at Bloody Brook had worked\r\nupon their minds, so that they no longer thought it worth while to keep\r\nfaith with the white men. They had overcome their timidity and were now\r\nready to take part in the work of massacre. [33] The Commissioners soon\r\nlearned of their warlike preparations and lost no time in forestalling\r\nthem. The Narragansetts were fairly warned that if they did not at once\r\nfulfil their promises they must expect the utmost severities of war. A\r\nthousand men were enlisted for this service and put under command of\r\nGovernor Winslow, and in December they marched against the enemy. The\r\nredoubtable fighter and lively chronicler Benjamin Church accompanied\r\nthe expedition.\r\n\r\nThe Indians had fortified themselves on a piece of rising ground, six\r\nacres in extent, in the middle of a hideous swamp impassable at most\r\nseasons but now in some places frozen hard enough to afford a precarious\r\nfooting. They were surrounded by rows of tall palisades which formed a\r\nwall twelve feet in thickness; and the only approach to the single door\r\nof this stronghold was over the trunk of a felled tree some two feet in\r\ndiameter and slippery with snow and ice. A stout block-house filled with\r\nsharpshooters guarded this rude bridge, which was raised some five feet\r\nfrom the ground. Within the palisaded fortress perhaps not less than\r\n2000 warriors, with many women and children, awaited the onset of the\r\nwhite men, for here had Canonchet gathered together nearly the whole of\r\nhis available force. This was a military mistake. It was cooping up his\r\nmen for slaughter. They would have been much safer if scattered about in\r\nthe wilderness, and could have given the English much more trouble. But\r\nreadily as they acknowledged the power of the white man, they did not\r\nyet understand it. One man\u0027s courage is not another\u0027s, and the Indian\r\nknew little or nothing of that Gothic fury of self-abandonment which\r\nrushes straight ahead and snatches victory from the jaws of death. His\r\nfortress was a strong one, and it was no longer, as in the time of the\r\nPequots, a strife in which firearms were pitted against bow and arrow.\r\nMany of the Narragansetts were equipped with muskets and skilled in\r\ntheir use, and under such circumstances victory for the English was not\r\nto be lightly won. [Sidenote: Expedition against the Narragansetts]\r\n\r\nOn the night of December 18 their little army slept in an open field\r\nat Pettyquamscott without other blanket than a \"moist fleece of snow.\"\r\nThence to the Indian fortress, situated in what is now South Kingston,\r\nthe march was eighteen miles. The morrow was a Sunday, but Winslow\r\ndeemed it imprudent to wait, as food had wellnigh given out. Getting up\r\nat five o\u0027clock, they toiled through deep snow till they came within\r\nsight of the Narragansett stronghold early in the afternoon. First came\r\nthe 527 men from Massachusetts, led by Major Appleton, of Ipswich, and\r\nnext the 158 from Plymouth, under Major Bradford; while Major Robert\r\nTreat, with the 300 from Connecticut, brought up the rear. There were\r\n985 men in all. As the Massachusetts men rushed upon the slippery bridge\r\na deadly volley from the blockhouse slew six of their captains, while\r\nof the rank and file there were many killed or wounded. Nothing daunted\r\nthey pressed on with great spirit till they forced their way into the\r\nenclosure, but then the head of their column, overcome by sheer weight\r\nof numbers in the hand-to-hand fight, was pushed and tumbled out into\r\nthe swamp. Meanwhile some of the Connecticut men had discovered a path\r\nacross the partly frozen swamp leading to a weak spot in the rear, where\r\nthe palisades were thin and few, as undue reliance had been placed upon\r\nthe steep bank crowned with a thick rampart of bushes that had been\r\nreinforced with clods of turf. In this direction Treat swept along with\r\nhis men in a spirited charge. Before they had reached the spot a heavy\r\nfire began mowing them down, but with a furious rush they came up, and\r\nclimbing on each other\u0027s shoulders, some fought their way over the\r\nrampart, while others hacked sturdily with axes till such a breach was\r\nmade that all might enter. This was effected just as the Massachusetts\r\nmen had recovered themselves and crossed the treacherous log in a second\r\ncharge that was successful and soon brought the entire English force\r\nwithin the enclosure. In the slaughter which filled the rest of that\r\nSunday afternoon till the sun went down behind a dull gray cloud, the\r\ngrim and wrathful Puritan, as he swung his heavy cutlass, thought of\r\nSaul and Agag, and spared not. The Lord had delivered up to him the\r\nheathen as stubble to his sword. As usual the number of the slain\r\nis variously estimated. Of the Indians probably not less than 1000\r\nperished. Some hundreds, however, with Canonchet their leader, saved\r\nthemselves in flight, well screened by the blinding snow-flakes that\r\nbegan to fall just after sunset. Within the fortified area had been\r\nstored the greater part of the Indians\u0027 winter supply of corn, and the\r\nloss of this food was a further deadly blow. Captain Church advised\r\nsparing the wigwams and using them for shelter, but Winslow seems to\r\nhave doubted the ability of his men to maintain themselves in a position\r\nso remote from all support. The wigwams with their tubs of corn were\r\nburned, and a retreat was ordered. Through snowdrifts that deepened\r\nevery moment the weary soldiers dragged themselves along until two hours\r\nafter midnight, when they reached the tiny village of Wickford. Nearly\r\none-fourth of their number had been killed or wounded, and many of the\r\nlatter perished before shelter was reached. Forty of these were buried\r\nat Wickford in the course of the next three days. Of the Connecticut men\r\neighty were left upon the swamp and in the breach at the rear of the\r\nstronghold. Among the spoils which the victors brought away were a\r\nnumber of good muskets that had been captured by the Nipmucks in their\r\nassault upon Deerfield. [Sidenote: Storming of the great swamp fortress,\r\nDecember 19]\r\n\r\nThis headlong overthrow of the Narragansett power completely changed the\r\nface of things. The question was no longer whether the red men could\r\npossibly succeed in making New England too hot for the white men, but\r\nsimply how long it would take for the white men to exterminate the red\r\nmen. The shiftless Indian was abandoning his squalid agriculture and\r\nsubsisting on the pillage of English farms; but the resources of the\r\ncolonies, though severely taxed, were by no means exhausted. The dusky\r\nwarriors slaughtered in the great swamp fight could not be replaced;\r\nbut, as Roger Williams told the Indians, there were still ten thousand\r\nwhite men who could carry muskets, and should all these be slain, he\r\nadded, with a touch of hyperbole, the Great Father in England could send\r\nten thousand more. For the moment Williams seems to have cherished a\r\nhope that his great influence with the savages might induce them to\r\nsubmit to terms of peace while there was yet a remnant to be saved; but\r\nthey were now as little inclined to parley as tigers brought to bay, nor\r\nwas the temper of the colonists a whit less deadly, though it did not\r\nvent itself in inflicting torture or in merely wanton orgies of cruelty.\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of the blow]\r\n\r\nTo the modern these scenes of carnage are painful to contemplate. In the\r\nwholesale destruction of the Pequots, and to a less degree in that of\r\nthe Narragansetts, the death-dealing power of the white man stands forth\r\nso terrible and relentless that our sympathy is for a moment called\r\nout for his victim. The feeling of tenderness toward the weak, almost\r\nunknown among savages, is one of the finest products of civilization.\r\nWhere murderous emotions are frequently excited, it cannot thrive. Such\r\nadvance in humanity as we have made within recent times is chiefly\r\ndue to the fact that the horrors of war are seldom brought home to\r\neverybody\u0027s door. Either war is conducted on some remote frontier, or if\r\narmies march through a densely peopled country the conditions of\r\nmodern warfare have made it essential to their efficiency as military\r\ninstruments that depredation and riot should be as far as possible\r\nchecked. Murder and pillage are comparatively infrequent, massacre\r\nis seldom heard of, and torture is almost or quite as extinct as\r\ncannibalism. The mass of citizens escape physical suffering, the angry\r\nemotions are so directed upon impersonal objects as to acquire a strong\r\nethical value, and the intervals of strife may find individual soldiers\r\nof hostile armies exchanging kindly services. Members of a complex\r\nindustrial society, without direct experience of warfare save in this\r\nmitigated form, have their characters wrought upon in a way that is\r\ndistinctively modern, as they become more and more disinclined to\r\nviolence and cruelty. European historians have noticed, with words\r\nof praise, the freedom from bloodthirstiness which characterizes the\r\nAmerican people. Mr. Lecky has more than once remarked upon this humane\r\ntemperament which is so characteristic of our peaceful civilization, and\r\nwhich sometimes, indeed, shows the defects of its excellence and tends\r\nto weaken society by making it difficult to inflict due punishment upon\r\nthe vilest criminals. In respect of this humanity the American of the\r\nnineteenth century has without doubt improved very considerably upon his\r\nforefathers of the seventeenth. The England of Cromwell and Milton\r\nwas not, indeed, a land of hard-hearted people as compared with their\r\ncontemporaries. The long experience of internal peace since the War\r\nof the Roses had not been without its effect; and while the Tudor and\r\nStuart periods had atrocities enough, we need only remember what was\r\ngoing on at the same time in France and Germany in order to realize how\r\nmuch worse it might have been. In England, as elsewhere, however, it\r\nwas, when looked at with our eyes, a rough and brutal time. It was a day\r\nof dungeons, whipping-posts, and thumbscrews, when slight offenders were\r\nmaimed and bruised and great offenders cut into pieces by sentence of\r\ncourt. The pioneers of New England had grown up familiar with such\r\nthings; and among the townspeople of Boston and Hartford in 1675 were\r\nstill many who in youth had listened to the awful news from Magdeburg or\r\nturned pale over the horrors in Piedmont upon which Milton invoked the\r\nwrath of Heaven. [Sidenote: Growth of humane sentiment in recent times]\r\n\r\nWhen civilized men are removed from the safeguards of civilization and\r\nplaced in the wilderness amid the hideous dangers that beset human\r\nexistence in a savage state of society, whatever barbarism lies latent\r\nin them is likely to find many opportunities for showing itself.\r\nThe feelings that stir the meekest of men, as he stands among the\r\nsmouldering embers of his homestead and gazes upon the mangled bodies\r\nof wife and children, are feelings that he shares with the most\r\nbloodthirsty savage, and the primary effect of his higher intelligence\r\nand greater sensitiveness is only to increase their bitterness. The\r\nneighbour who hears the dreadful story is quick to feel likewise, for\r\nthe same thing may happen to him, and there is nothing so pitiless as\r\nfear. With the Puritan such gloomy and savage passions seemed to find\r\njustification in the sacred text from which he drew his rules of life.\r\nTo suppose that one part of the Bible could be less authoritative than\r\nanother would have been to him an incomprehensible heresy; and bound\r\nbetween the same covers that included the Sermon on the Mount were tales\r\nof wholesale massacre perpetrated by God\u0027s command. Evidently the\r\nred men were not stray children of Israel, after all, but rather\r\nPhilistines, Canaanites, heathen, sons of Belial, firebrands of hell,\r\ndemons whom it was no more than right to sweep from the face of the\r\nearth. Writing in this spirit, the chroniclers of the time were\r\ncompletely callous in their accounts of suffering and ruin inflicted\r\nupon Indians, and, as has elsewhere been known to happen, those who\r\ndid not risk their own persons were more truculent in tone than the\r\nprofessional fighters. Of the narrators of the war, perhaps the fairest\r\ntoward the Indian is the doughty Captain Church, while none is more\r\nbitter and cynical than the Ipswich pastor William Hubbard. [Sidenote:\r\nWarfare with savages likely to be truculent in character]\r\n\r\nWhile the overthrow of the Narragansetts changed the face of things, it\r\nwas far from putting an end to the war. It showed that when the white\r\nman could find his enemy he could deal crushing blows, but the Indian\r\nwas not always so easy to find. Before the end of January Winslow\u0027s\r\nlittle army was partially disbanded for want of food, and its three\r\ncontingents fell back upon Stonington, Boston, and Plymouth. Early in\r\nFebruary the Federal Commissioners called for a new levy of 600 men to\r\nassemble at Brookfield, for the Nipmucks were beginning to renew their\r\nincursions, and after an interval of six months the figure of Philip\r\nagain appears for a moment upon the scene. What he had been doing, or\r\nwhere he had been, since the Brookfield fight in August, was never\r\nknown. When in February, 1676, he re-appeared it was still in company\r\nwith his allies the Nipmucks, in their bloody assault upon Lancaster.\r\nOn the 10th of that month at sunrise the Indians came swarming into the\r\nlovely village. Danger had already been apprehended, the pastor, Joseph\r\nRowlandson, the only Harvard graduate of 1652, had gone to Boston to\r\nsolicit aid, and Captain Wadsworth\u0027s company was slowly making its\r\nway over the difficult roads from Marlborough, but the Indians were\r\nbeforehand. Several houses were at once surrounded and set on fire,\r\nand men, women, and children began falling under the tomahawk. The\r\nminister\u0027s house was large and strongly built, and more than forty\r\npeople found shelter there until at length it took fire and they were\r\ndriven out by the flames. Only one escaped, a dozen or more were slain,\r\nand the rest, chiefly women and children, taken captive. The Indians\r\naimed at plunder as well as destruction; for they were in sore need of\r\nfood and blankets, as well as of powder and ball. Presently, as they saw\r\nWadsworth\u0027s armed men approaching, they took to flight and got away,\r\nwith many prisoners and a goodly store of provisions. [Sidenote: Attack\r\nupon Lancaster, February 10, 1676]\r\n\r\nAmong the captives was Mary Rowlandson, the minister\u0027s wife, who\r\nafterward wrote the story of her sad experiences. The treatment of the\r\nprisoners varied with the caprice or the cupidity of the captors. Those\r\nfor whom a substantial ransom might be expected fared comparatively\r\nwell; to others death came as a welcome relief. One poor woman with a\r\nchild in her arms was too weak to endure the arduous tramp over the icy\r\nhillsides, and begged to be left behind, till presently the savages\r\nlost their patience. They built a fire, and after a kind of demon dance\r\nkilled mother and child with a club and threw the bodies into the\r\nflames. Such treatment may seem exceptionally merciful, but those modern\r\nobservers who best know the Indian\u0027s habits say that he seldom indulges\r\nin torture except when he has abundance of leisure and a mind quite\r\nundisturbed. He is an epicure in human agony and likes to enjoy it in\r\nlong slow sips. It is for the end of the march that the accumulation\r\nof horrors is reserved; the victims by the way are usually despatched\r\nquickly; and in the case of Mrs. Rowlandson\u0027s captors their irregular\r\nand circuitous march indicates that they were on the alert. Their\r\nmovements seem to have covered much of the ground between Wachusett\r\nmountain and the Connecticut river. They knew that the white squaw of\r\nthe great medicine man of an English village was worth a heavy ransom,\r\nand so they treated Mrs. Rowlandson unusually well. She had been\r\ncaptured when escaping from the burning house, carrying in her arms her\r\nlittle six-year-old daughter. She was stopped by a bullet that grazed\r\nher side and struck the child. The Indian who seized them placed the\r\nlittle girl upon a horse, and as the dreary march began she kept moaning\r\n\"I shall die, mamma.\" \"I went on foot after it,\" says the mother, \"with\r\nsorrow that cannot be expressed. At length I took it off the horse, and\r\ncarried it in my arms till my strength failed me, and I fell down with\r\nit .... After this it quickly began to snow, and when night came on they\r\nstopped. And now down I must sit in the snow, by a little fire, and a\r\nfew boughs behind me, with my sick child in my lap, and calling much for\r\nwater, being now, through the wound, fallen into a violent fever ....\r\nOh, may I see the wonderful power of God that my spirit did not utterly\r\nsink under my affliction; still the Lord upheld me with his gracious and\r\nmerciful spirit.\" The little girl soon died. For three months the weary\r\nand heartbroken mother was led about the country by these loathsome\r\nsavages, of whose habits and manners she gives a vivid description. At\r\nfirst their omnivorousness astonished her. \"Skunks and rattlesnakes, yea\r\nthe very bark of trees\" they esteemed as delicacies. \"They would pick up\r\nold bones and cut them in pieces at the joints, ... then boil them and\r\ndrink up the liquor, and then beat the great ends of them in a mortar\r\nand so eat them.\" After some weeks of starvation Mrs. Rowlandson herself\r\nwas fain to partake of such viands. One day, having made a cap for one\r\nof Philip\u0027s boys, she was invited to dine with the great sachem. \"I\r\nwent,\" she says, \"and he gave me a pancake about as big as two fingers.\r\nIt was made of parched wheat, beaten, and fried in bear\u0027s grease; but I\r\nthought I never tasted pleasanter meat in my life.\" Early in May she was\r\nredeemed for 20 pounds, and went to find her husband in Boston, where\r\nthe Old South Church society hired a house for them. [Sidenote: Mrs.\r\nRowlandson\u0027s narrative]\r\n\r\nSuch was the experience of a captive whose treatment was, according to\r\nIndian notions, hospitable. There were few who came off so well. Almost\r\nevery week while she was led hither and thither by the savages. Mrs.\r\nRowlandson heard ghastly tales of fire and slaughter. It was a busy\r\nwinter and spring for these Nipmucks. Before February was over, their\r\nexploit at Lancaster was followed by a shocking massacre at Medfield.\r\nThey sacked and destroyed the towns of Worcester, Marlborough, Mendon,\r\nand Groton, and even burned some houses in Weymouth, within a dozen\r\nmiles of Boston. Murderous attacks were made upon Sudbury, Chelmsford,\r\nSpringfield, Hatfield, Hadley, Northampton, Wrentham, Andover,\r\nBridgewater, Scituate, and Middleborough. On the 18th of April Captain\r\nWadsworth, with 70 men, was drawn into an ambush near Sudbury,\r\nsurrounded by 500 Nipmucks, and killed with 50 of his men; six\r\nunfortunate captives were burned alive over slow fires. But Wadsworth\u0027s\r\nparty made the enemy pay dearly for his victory; that afternoon 120\r\nNipmucks bit the dust. In such wise, by killing two or three for one,\r\ndid the English wear out and annihilate their adversaries. Just one\r\nmonth from that day Captain Turner surprised and slaughtered 300 of\r\nthese warriors near the falls of the Connecticut river which have\r\nsince borne his name, and this blow at last broke the strength of\r\nthe Nipmucks. [Sidenote: Virtual exterminations of the Indians,\r\nFebruary--August, 1676]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Narragansetts and Wampanoags had burned the towns of\r\nWarwick and Providence. After the wholesale ruin of the great \"swamp\r\nfight,\" Canonchet had still some 600 or 700 warriors left, and with\r\nthese, on the 26th of March, in the neighbourhood of Pawtuxet, he\r\nsurprised a company of 50 Plymouth men under Captain Pierce and slew\r\nthem all, but not until he had lost 140 of his best warriors. Ten days\r\nlater Captain Denison, with his Connecticut company, defeated and\r\ncaptured Canonchet, and the proud son of Miantonomo met the same fate\r\nas his father. He was handed over to the Mohegans and tomahawked. The\r\nNarragansett sachem had shown such bravery that it seemed, says the\r\nchronicler Hubbard, as if \"some old Roman ghost had possessed the body\r\nof this western pagan.\" But next moment this pious clergyman, as if\r\nashamed of the classical eulogy just bestowed upon the hated redskin,\r\nalludes to him as a \"damned wretch.\" [Sidenote: Death of Canonchet]\r\n\r\nThe fall of Canonchet marked the beginning of the end. In four sharp\r\nfights in the last week of June, Major Talcott, of Hartford, slew\r\nfrom 300 to 400 warriors, being nearly all that were left of the\r\nNarragansetts; and during the month of July Captain Church patrolled the\r\ncountry about Taunton, making prisoners of the Wampanoags. Once more\r\nKing Philip, shorn of his prestige, comes upon the scene. We have seen\r\nthat his agency in these cruel events had been at the outset a potent\r\none. Whatever else it may have been, it was at least the agency of the\r\nmatch that explodes the powder-cask. Under the conditions of that savage\r\nsociety, organized leadership was not to be looked for. In the irregular\r\nand disorderly series of murdering raids Philip may have been often\r\npresent, but except for Mrs. Rowlandson\u0027s narrative we should have known\r\nnothing of him since the Brookfield fight.\r\n\r\nAt length in July, 1676, having seen the last of his Nipmuck friends\r\noverwhelmed, the tattered chieftain showed himself near Bridgewater,\r\nwith a handful of followers. In these his own hunting-grounds some of\r\nhis former friends had become disaffected. The daring and diplomatic\r\nChurch had made his way into the wigwam of Ashawonks, the squaw sachem\r\nof Saconet, near Little Compton, and having first convinced her that a\r\nflask of brandy might be tasted without fatal results, followed up his\r\nadvantage and persuaded her to make an alliance with the English. Many\r\nIndians came in and voluntarily surrendered themselves, in order to\r\nobtain favourable terms, and some lent their aid in destroying their old\r\nsachem. Defeated at Taunton, the son of Massasoit was hunted by Church\r\nto his ancient lair at Bristol Neck and there besieged. His only escape\r\nwas over the narrow isthmus of which the pursuers now took possession,\r\nand in this dire extremity one of Philip\u0027s men presumed to advise his\r\nchief that the hour for surrender had come. For his unwelcome counsel\r\nthe sachem forthwith lifted his tomahawk and struck him dead at his\r\nfeet. Then the brother of the slain man crept away through the bushes to\r\nChurch\u0027s little camp, and offered to guide the white men to the morass\r\nwhere Philip lay concealed. At daybreak of August 12 the English\r\nstealthily advancing beat up their prey. The savages in sudden panic\r\nrushed from under cover, and as the sachem showed himself running at the\r\ntop of his speed, a ball from an Indian musket pierced his heart, and\r\n\"he fell upon his face in the mud and water, with his gun under him.\"\r\nHis severed head was sent to Plymouth, where it was mounted on a pole\r\nand exposed aloft upon the village green, while the meeting-house\r\nbell summoned the townspeople to a special service of thanksgiving.\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Philip, August 12]\r\n\r\nIt may be supposed that in such services at this time a Christian\r\nfeeling of charity and forgiveness was not uppermost. Among the captives\r\nwas a son of Philip, the little swarthy lad of nine years for whom Mrs.\r\nRowlandson had made a cap, and the question as to what was to be done\r\nwith him occasioned as much debate as if he had been a Jesse Pomeroy\r\n[34] or a Chicago anarchist. The opinions of the clergy were, of course,\r\neagerly sought and freely vouchsafed. One minister somewhat doubtfully\r\nurged that \"although a precept in Deuteronomy explicitly forbids killing\r\nthe child for the father\u0027s sin,\" yet after all \"the children of Saul and\r\nAchan perished with their parents, though too young to have shared their\r\nguilt.\" Thus curiously did this English reverence for precedent, with a\r\nsort of grim conscientiousness colouring its gloomy wrath, search for\r\nguidance among the ancient records of the children of Israel. Commenting\r\nupon the truculent suggestion, Increase Mather, soon to be president of\r\nHarvard, observed that, \"though David had spared the infant Hadad, yet\r\nit might have been better for his people if he had been less merciful.\"\r\nThese bloodthirsty counsels did not prevail, but the course that was\r\nadopted did not lack in harshness. Among the sachems a dozen leading\r\nspirits were hanged or shot, and hundreds of captives were shipped off\r\nto the West Indies to be sold into slavery; among these was Philip\u0027s\r\nlittle son. The rough soldier Church and the apostle Eliot were among\r\nthe few who disapproved of this policy. Church feared it might goad such\r\nIndians as were still at large to acts of desperation. Eliot, in an\r\nearnest letter to the Federal Commissioners, observed: \"To sell souls\r\nfor money seemeth to me dangerous merchandise.\" But the plan of\r\nexporting the captives was adhered to. As slaves they were understood to\r\nbe of little or no value, and sometimes for want of purchasers they were\r\nset ashore on strange coasts and abandoned. A few were even carried to\r\none of the foulest of mediaeval slave-marts, Morocco, where their fate\r\nwas doubtless wretched enough. [Sidenote: Indians sold into slavery]\r\n\r\nIn spite of Church\u0027s doubts as to the wisdom of this harsh treatment,\r\nit did not prevent the beaten and starving savages from surrendering\r\nthemselves in considerable numbers. To some the Federal Commissioners\r\noffered amnesty, and the promise was faithfully fulfilled. Among those\r\nwho laid down arms in reliance upon it were 140 Christian Indians, with\r\ntheir leader known as James the Printer, because he had been employed at\r\nCambridge in setting up the type for Eliot\u0027s Bible. Quite early in the\r\nwar it had been discovered that these converted savages still felt the\r\nties of blood to be stronger than those of creed. At the attack on\r\nMendon, only three weeks after the horrors at Swanzey that ushered in\r\nthe war, it was known that Christian Indians had behaved themselves\r\nquite as cruelly as their unregenerate brethren. Afterwards they made\r\nsuch a record that the jokers and punsters of the day--for such there\r\nwere, even among those sombre Puritans--in writing about the \"Praying\r\nIndians,\" spelled _praying_ with an _e_. The moral scruples of these\r\nsavages, under the influence of their evangelical training, betrayed\r\nqueer freaks. One of them, says Mrs. Rowlandson, would rather die than\r\neat horseflesh, so narrow and scrupulous was his conscience, although it\r\nwas as wide as the whole infernal abyss, when it came to torturing\r\nwhite Christians. The student of history may have observed similar\r\ninconsistencies in the theories and conduct of people more enlightened\r\nthan these poor red men. \"There was another Praying Indian,\" continues\r\nMrs. Rowlandson, \"who, when he had done all the mischief he could,\r\nbetrayed his own father into the English\u0027s hands, thereby to purchase\r\nhis own life; ... and there was another ... so wicked ... as to wear\r\na string about his neck, strung with Christian fingers.\" [Sidenote:\r\nConduct of the Christian Indians]\r\n\r\nSuch incidents help us to comprehend the exasperation of our forefathers\r\nin the days of King Philip. The month which witnessed his death saw also\r\nthe end of the war in the southern parts of New England; but, almost\r\nbefore people had time to offer thanks for the victory, there came news\r\nof bloodshed on the northeastern frontier. The Tarratines in Maine had\r\nfor some time been infected with the war fever. How far they may have\r\nbeen comprehended in the schemes of Philip and Canonchet, it would be\r\nhard to say. They had attacked settlers on the site of Brunswick as\r\nearly as September, 1675. About the time of Philip\u0027s death, Major\r\nWaldron of Dover had entrapped a party of them by an unworthy stratagem,\r\nand after satisfying himself that they were accomplices in that\r\nchieftain\u0027s scheme, sent them to Boston to be sold into slavery. A\r\nterrible retribution was in store for Major Waldron thirteen years\r\nlater. For the present the hideous strife, just ended in southern New\r\nEngland, was continued on the northeastern frontier, and there was\r\nscarcely a village between the Kennebec and the Piscataqua but was laid\r\nin ashes. [Sidenote: War with the Tarratines, 1676-78]\r\n\r\nBy midsummer of 1678 the Indians had been everywhere suppressed, and\r\nthere was peace in the land. For three years, since Philip\u0027s massacre\r\nat Swanzey, there had been a reign of terror in New England. Within\r\nthe boundaries of Connecticut, indeed, little or no damage had been\r\ninflicted, and the troops of that colony, not needed on their own soil,\r\ndid noble service in the common cause.\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts and Plymouth, on the other hand, the destruction of\r\nlife and property had been simply frightful. Of ninety towns, twelve had\r\nbeen utterly destroyed, while more than forty others had been the scene\r\nof fire and slaughter. Out of this little society nearly a thousand\r\nstaunch men, including not few of broad culture and strong promise, had\r\nlost their lives, while of the scores of fair women and poor little\r\nchildren that had perished under the ruthless tomahawk, one can hardly\r\ngive an accurate account. Hardly a family throughout the land but was\r\nin mourning. The war-debt of Plymouth was reckoned to exceed the total\r\namount of personal property in the colony; yet although it pinched every\r\nhousehold for many a year, it was paid to the uttermost farthing; nor\r\nin this respect were Massachusetts and Connecticut at all behind-hand.\r\n[Sidenote: Destructiveness of the war]\r\n\r\nBut while King Philip\u0027s War wrought such fearful damage to the English,\r\nit was for the Indians themselves utter destruction. Most of the\r\nwarriors were slain, and to the survivors, as we have seen, the\r\nconquerors showed but scant mercy. The Puritan, who conned his Bible so\r\nearnestly, had taken his hint from the wars of the Jews, and swept\r\nhis New English Canaan with a broom that was pitiless and searching.\r\nHenceforth the red man figures no more in the history of New England,\r\nexcept as an ally of the French in bloody raids upon the frontier. In\r\nthat capacity he does mischief enough for yet a half-century more, but\r\nfrom central and southern New England, as an element of disturbance or a\r\npower to be reckoned with, he disappears forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE TYRANNY OF ANDROS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of New England were made in the full daylight of modern\r\nhistory. It was an age of town records, of registered deeds, of\r\ncontemporary memoirs, of diplomatic correspondence, of controversial\r\npamphlets, funeral sermons, political diatribes, specific instructions,\r\nofficial reports, and private letters. It was not a time in which\r\nmythical personages or incredible legends could flourish, and such\r\nthings we do find in the history of New England. There was nevertheless\r\na romantic side to this history, enough to envelop some of its\r\ncharacters and incidents in a glamour that may mislead the modern\r\nreader. This wholesale migration from the smiling fields of merry\r\nEngland to an unexplored wilderness beyond a thousand leagues of sea was\r\nof itself a most romantic and thrilling event, and when viewed in the\r\nlight of its historic results it becomes clothed with sublimity. The men\r\nwho undertook this work were not at all free from self-consciousness.\r\nThey believed that they were doing a wonderful thing. They felt\r\nthemselves to be instruments in accomplishing a kind of \"manifest\r\ndestiny.\" Their exodus was that of a chosen people who were at length\r\nto lay the everlasting foundations of God\u0027s kingdom upon earth. Such\r\nopinions, which took a strong colour from their assiduous study of the\r\nOld Testament, reacted and disposed them all the more to search its\r\npages for illustrations and precedents, and to regard it as an oracle,\r\nalmost as a talisman. In every propitious event they saw a special\r\nprovidence, an act of divine intervention to deliver them from the\r\nsnares of an ever watchful Satan. This steadfast faith in an unseen\r\nruler and guide was to them a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by\r\nnight. It was of great moral value. It gave them clearness of purpose\r\nand concentration of strength, and contributed toward making them,\r\nlike the children of Israel, a people of indestructible vitality and\r\naggressive energy. At the same time, in the hands of the Puritan\r\nwriters, this feeling was apt to warp their estimates of events and\r\nthrow such a romantic haze about things as seriously to interfere with a\r\ntrue historical perspective. [Sidenote: Romantic features in the early\r\nhistory of New England]\r\n\r\nAmong such writings that which perhaps best epitomizes the Puritan\r\nphilosophy is \"The Wonder-working Providence of Zion\u0027s Saviour in New\r\nEngland,\" by Captain Edward Johnson, one of the principal founders of\r\nWoburn. It is an extremely valuable history of New England from 1628 to\r\n1651, and every page is alive with the virile energy of that stirring\r\ntime. With narrative, argument, and apologue, abounding in honesty\r\nof purpose, sublimity of trust, and grotesqueness of fancy, wherein\r\ntouching tenderness is often alternated with sternness most grim and\r\nmerciless, yet now and then relieved by a sudden gleam of humour,--and\r\nall in a style that is usually uncouth and harsh, but sometimes bursts\r\nforth in eloquence worthy of Bunyan,--we are told how the founders of\r\nNew England are soldiers of Christ enlisted in a holy war, and how they\r\nmust \"march manfully on till all opposers of Christ\u0027s kingly power be\r\nabolished.\" \"And as for you who are called to sound forth his silver\r\ntrumpets, blow loud and shrill to this chiefest treble tune--for the\r\narmies of the great Jehovah are at hand.\" \"He standeth not as an idle\r\nspectator beholding his people\u0027s ruth and their enemies\u0027 rage, but as an\r\nactor in all actions, to bring to naught the desires of the wicked, ...\r\nhaving also the ordering of every weapon in its first produce, guiding\r\nevery shaft that flies, leading each bullet to his place of settling,\r\nand weapon to the wound it makes.\" To men engaged in such a crusade\r\nagainst the powers of evil, nothing could seem insignificant or trivial;\r\nfor, as Johnson continues, in truly prophetic phrase, \"the Lord Christ\r\nintends to achieve greater matters by this little handful than the world\r\nis aware of.\" [Sidenote: Edward Johnson]\r\n\r\nThe general sentiment of the early New England writers was like that\r\nof the \"Wonder-working Providence,\" though it did not always find such\r\nrhapsodic expression. It has left its impress upon the minds of their\r\nchildren\u0027s children down to our own time, and has affected the opinions\r\nheld about them by other people. It has had something to do with a\r\ncertain tacit assumption of superiority on the part of New Englanders,\r\nupon which the men and women of other communities have been heard\r\nto comment in resentful and carping tones. There has probably never\r\nexisted, in any age or at any spot on the earth\u0027s surface, a group of\r\npeople that did not take for granted its own preeminent excellence. Upon\r\nsome such assumption, as upon an incontrovertible axiom, all historical\r\nnarratives, from the chronicles of a parish to the annals of an empire,\r\nalike proceed. But in New England it assumed a form especially apt to\r\nprovoke challenge. One of its unintentional effects was the setting up\r\nof an unreal and impossible standard by which to judge the acts and\r\nmotives of the Puritans of the seventeenth century. We come upon\r\ninstances of harshness and cruelty, of narrow-minded bigotry, and\r\nsuperstitious frenzy; and feel, perhaps, a little surprised that\r\nthese men had so much in common with their contemporaries. Hence the\r\ninterminable discussion which has been called forth by the history of\r\nthe Puritans, in which the conclusions of the writer have generally been\r\ndetermined by circumstances of birth or creed, or perhaps of reaction\r\nagainst creed. One critic points to the Boston of 1659 or the Salem of\r\n1692 with such gleeful satisfaction as used to stir the heart of Thomas\r\nPaine when he alighted upon an inconsistency in some text of the Bible;\r\nwhile another, in the firm conviction that Puritans could do no wrong,\r\nplays fast and loose with arguments that might be made to justify the\r\ndeeds of a Torquemada. [Sidenote: Acts of the Puritans often judged by a\r\nwrong standard]\r\n\r\nFrom such methods of criticism it is the duty of historians as far as\r\npossible to free themselves. If we consider the Puritans in the light\r\nof their surroundings as Englishmen of the seventeenth century and\r\ninaugurators of a political movement that was gradually to change for\r\nthe better the aspect of things all over the earth, we cannot fail to\r\ndiscern the value of that sacred enthusiasm which led them to regard\r\nthemselves as chosen soldiers of Christ. It was the spirit of the\r\n\"Wonder-working Providence\" that hurled the tyrant from his throne at\r\nWhitehall and prepared the way for the emancipation of modern Europe. No\r\nspirit less intense, no spirit nurtured in the contemplation of things\r\nterrestrial, could ever have done it. The political philosophy of a Vane\r\nor a Sidney could never have done it. The passion for liberty as felt\r\nby a Jefferson or an Adams, abstracted and generalized from the love\r\nof particular liberties, was something scarcely intelligible to the\r\nseventeenth century. The ideas of absolute freedom of thought and\r\nspeech, which we breathe in from childhood, were to the men of that age\r\nstrange and questionable. They groped and floundered among them, very\r\nmuch as modern wool growers in Ohio or iron-smelters in Pennsylvania\r\nflounder and grope among the elementary truths of political economy. But\r\nthe spirit in which the Hebrew prophet rebuked and humbled an idolatrous\r\nking was a spirit they could comprehend. Such a spirit was sure to\r\nmanifest itself in narrow cramping measures and in ugly acts of\r\npersecution; but it is none the less to the fortunate alliance of\r\nthat fervid religious enthusiasm with the Englishman\u0027s love of\r\nself-government that our modern freedom owes its existence. [Sidenote:\r\nSpirit of the Wonder-working Providence]\r\n\r\nThe history of New England under Charles II. yields abundant proof that\r\npolitical liberty is no less indebted in the New World than in the Old\r\nto the spirit of the \"Wonder-working Providence.\" The theocratic ideal\r\nwhich the Puritan sought to put into practice in Massachusetts and\r\nConnecticut was a sacred institution in faults of the defence of\r\nwhich all his faculties were kept perpetually alert. Much as he loved\r\nself-government he would never have been so swift to detect and so\r\nstubborn to resist every slightest encroachment on the part of the crown\r\nhad not the loss of self-government involved the imminent danger that\r\nthe ark of the Lord might be abandoned to the worshippers of Dagon.\r\nIt was in Massachusetts, where the theocracy was strongest, that the\r\nresistance to Charles II. was most dogged and did most to prepare the\r\nway for the work of achieving political independence a century later.\r\nNaturally it was in Massachusetts at the same time that the faults\r\nof the theocracy were most conspicuous. It was there that priestly\r\nauthority most clearly asserted itself in such oppressive acts as are\r\nalways witnessed when too much power is left in the hands of men whose\r\nprimary allegiance is to a kingdom not of this world. Much as we owe to\r\nthe theocracy for warding off the encroachments of the crown, we cannot\r\nbe sorry that it was itself crushed in the process. It was well that\r\nit did not survive its day of usefulness, and that the outcome of\r\nthe struggle was what has been aptly termed \"the emancipation of\r\nMassachusetts.\" [Sidenote: Merits and faults of the theocracy]\r\n\r\nThe basis of the theocratic constitution of this commonwealth was the\r\nprovision by which the exercise of the franchise was made an incident of\r\nchurch-membership. Unless a man could take part in the Lord\u0027s Supper, as\r\nadministered in the churches of the colony, he could not vote or\r\nhold office. Church and state, parish and town, were thus virtually\r\nidentified. Here, as in some other aspects of early New England, one is\r\nreminded of the ancient Greek cities, where the freeman who could\r\nvote in the market-place or serve his turn as magistrate was the man\r\nqualified to perform sacrifices to the tutelar deities of the tribe;\r\nother men might dwell in the city but had no share in making or\r\nexecuting its laws. The limitation of civil rights by religious tests is\r\nindeed one of those common inheritances from the old Aryan world that\r\nwe find again and again cropping out, even down to the exclusion of\r\nCatholics from the House of Commons from 1562 to 1829. The obvious\r\npurpose of this policy in England was self-protection; and in like\r\nmanner the restriction of the suffrage in Massachusetts was designed\r\nto protect the colony against aggressive episcopacy and to maintain\r\nunimpaired the uniformity of purpose which had brought the settlers\r\nacross the ocean. Under the circumstances there was something to be\r\nsaid in behalf of such a measure of self-protection, and the principle\r\nrequired but slight extension to cover such cases as the banishment of\r\nRoger Williams and the Antinomians. There was another side to the case,\r\nhowever. From the very outset this exclusive policy was in some ways\r\na source of weakness to Massachusetts, though we have seen that the\r\nindirect effect was to diversify and enrich the political life of New\r\nEngland as a whole. [Sidenote: Restriction of the suffrage to church\r\nmembers]\r\n\r\nAt first it led to the departure of the men who founded Connecticut,\r\nand thereafter the way was certainly open for those who preferred the\r\nConnecticut policy to go where it prevailed. Some such segregation was\r\nno doubt effected, but it could not be complete and thorough. Men who\r\npreferred Boston without the franchise to Hartford with it would remain\r\nin Massachusetts; and thus the elder colony soon came to possess a\r\ndiscontented class of people, always ready to join hand in glove with\r\ndissenters or mischief-makers, or even with emissaries of the crown. It\r\nafforded a suggestive commentary upon all attempts to suppress human\r\nnature by depriving it of a share in political life; instead of keeping\r\nit inside where you can try conclusions with it fairly, you thrust it\r\nout to plot mischief in the dark. Within twenty years from the founding\r\nof Boston the disfranchisement of such citizens as could not participate\r\nin church-communion had begun to be regarded as a serious political\r\ngrievance. These men were obliged to pay taxes and were liable to be\r\ncalled upon for military service against the Indians; and they naturally\r\nfelt that they ought to have a voice in the management of public\r\naffairs. [Sidenote: It was a source of political discontent]\r\n\r\nBesides this fundamental ground of complaint, there were derivative\r\ngrievances. Under the influence of the clergy justice was administered\r\nin somewhat inquisitorial fashion, there was an uncertainty as to just\r\nwhat the law was, a strong disposition to confuse questions of law with\r\nquestions of ethics, and great laxity in the admission and estimation of\r\nevidence. As early as 1639 people had begun to complain that too much\r\npower was rested in the discretion of the magistrate, and they clamoured\r\nfor a code of laws; but as Winthrop says, the magistrates and ministers\r\nwere \"not very forward in this matter,\" for they preferred to supplement\r\nthe common law of England by decisions based on the Old Testament rather\r\nthan by a body of statutes. It was not until 1649, after a persistent\r\nstruggle, that the deputies won a decisive victory over the assistants\r\nand secured for Massachusetts a definite code of laws. In the New Haven\r\ncolony similar theocratic notions led the settlers to dispense with\r\ntrial by jury because they could find no precedent for it in the laws of\r\nMoses. Here, as in Massachusetts, the inquisitorial administration of\r\njustice combined with partial disfranchisement to awaken discontent, and\r\nit was partly for this reason that New Haven fell so easily under the\r\nsway of Connecticut. [Sidenote: Inquisitorial administration of justice]\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts after 1650 the opinion rapidly gained ground that all\r\nbaptized persons of upright and decorous lives ought to be considered,\r\nfor practical purposes, as members of the church, and therefore entitled\r\nto the exercise of political rights, even though unqualified for\r\nparticipation in the Lord\u0027s Supper. This theory of church-membership,\r\nbased on what was at that time stigmatized as the \"Halfway Covenant,\"\r\naroused intense opposition. It was the great question of the day. In\r\n1657 a council was held in Boston, which approved the principle of the\r\nHalfway Covenant; and as this decision was far from satisfying the\r\nchurches, a synod of all the clergymen in Massachusetts was held five\r\nyears later, to reconsider the great question. The decision of the synod\r\nsubstantially confirmed the decision of the council, but there were some\r\ndissenting voices. Foremost among the dissenters, who wished to retain\r\nthe old theocratic regime in all its strictness, was Charles Chauncey,\r\nthe president of Harvard College, and Increase Mather agreed with him\r\nat the time, though he afterward saw reason to change his opinion, and\r\npublished two tracts in favour of the Halfway Covenant. Most bitter of\r\nall toward the new theory of church-membership was, naturally enough,\r\nMr. Davenport of New Haven. [Sidenote: The \"Halfway Covenant\"]\r\n\r\nThis burning question was the source of angry contentions in the First\r\nChurch of Boston. Its teacher, the learned and melancholy Norton, died\r\nin 1663, and four years later the aged pastor, John Wilson, followed\r\nhim. In choosing a successor to Wilson the church decided to declare\r\nitself in opposition to the liberal decision of the synod, and in token\r\nthereof invited Davenport to come from New Haven to take charge of it.\r\nDavenport, who was then seventy years old, was disgusted at the recent\r\nannexation of his colony to Connecticut. He accepted the invitation\r\nand came to Boston, against the wishes of nearly half of the Boston\r\ncongregation who did not like the illiberal principle which he\r\nrepresented. In little more than a year his ministry at Boston was ended\r\nby death; but the opposition to his call had already proceeded so far\r\nthat a secession from the old church had become inevitable. In 1669\r\nthe advocates of the Halfway Covenant organized themselves into a new\r\nsociety under the title of the \"Third Church in Boston.\" A wooden\r\nmeeting-house was built on a lot which had once belonged to the late\r\ngovernor Winthrop, in what was then the south part of the town, so that\r\nthe society and its meeting-house became known as the South Church; and\r\nafter a new church founded in Summer Street in 1717 took the name of the\r\nNew South, the church of 1669 came to be further distinguished as the\r\nOld South. As this church represented a liberal idea which was growing\r\nin favour with the people, it soon became the most flourishing church\r\nin America. After sixty years its numbers had increased so that the old\r\nmeeting-house could not contain them; and in 1729 the famous building\r\nwhich still stands was erected on the same spot,--a building with a\r\ngrander history than any other on the American continent, unless it be\r\nthat other plain brick building in Philadelphia where the Declaration of\r\nIndependence was adopted and the Federal Constitution framed. [Sidenote:\r\nFounding of the Old South Church, 1669]\r\n\r\nThe wrath of the First Church at this secession from its ranks was\r\ndeep and bitter, and for thirteen years it refused to entertain\r\necclesiastical intercourse with the South Church. But by 1682 it had\r\nbecome apparent that the king and his friends were meditating an attack\r\nupon the Puritan theocracy in New England. It had even been suggested,\r\nin the council for the colonies, that the Church of England should be\r\nestablished in Massachusetts, and that none but duly ordained Episcopal\r\nclergymen should be allowed to solemnize marriages. Such alarming\r\nsuggestions began to impress the various Puritan churches with the\r\nimportance of uniting their forces against the common enemy; and\r\naccordingly in 1682 the quarrel between the two Boston societies came to\r\nan end. There was urgent need of all the sympathy and good feeling that\r\nthe community could muster, whereby to cheer itself in the crisis that\r\nwas coming. The four years from 1684 to 1688 were the darkest years in\r\nthe history of New England. Massachusetts, though not lacking in the\r\nspirit, had not the power to beard the tyrant as she did eighty years\r\nlater. Her attitude toward the Stuarts--as we have seen--had been\r\nsometimes openly haughty and defiant, sometimes silent and sullen, but\r\nalways independent. At the accession of Charles II. the colonists had\r\nthought it worth while to send commissioners to England to confer with\r\nthe king and avoid a quarrel. Charles promised to respect their charter,\r\nbut insisted that in return they must take an oath of allegiance to the\r\ncrown, must administer justice in the king\u0027s name, and must repeal their\r\nlaws restricting the right of suffrage to church members and prohibiting\r\nthe Episcopal form of worship. [Sidenote: Founding of the Old South\r\nChurch, 1669] [Sidenote: Demands of Charles II.]\r\n\r\nWhen the people of Massachusetts received this message they consented to\r\nadminister justice in the king\u0027s name, but all the other matters were\r\nreferred for consideration to a committee, and so they dropped out of\r\nsight. When the royal commissioners came to Boston in 1664, they were\r\nespecially instructed to ascertain whether Massachusetts had complied\r\nwith the king\u0027s demands; but upon this point the legislature stubbornly\r\nwithheld any definite answer, while it frittered away the time in\r\ntrivial altercations with the royal commissioners. The war with Holland\r\nand the turbulent state of English politics operated for several years\r\nin favour of this independent attitude of the colonists, though during\r\nall this time their enemies at court were busy with intrigues and\r\naccusations. Apart from mere slanders the real grounds of complaint\r\nwere the restriction of the suffrage, whereby members of the Church of\r\nEngland were shut out; the claims of the eastern proprietors, heirs\r\nof Mason and Gorges, whose territory Massachusetts had absorbed;\r\nthe infraction of the navigation laws; and the coinage of pine-tree\r\nshillings. The last named measure had been forced upon the colonists by\r\nthe scarcity of a circulating medium. Until 1661 Indian wampum had been\r\na legal tender, and far into the eighteenth century it remained current\r\nin small transactions. \"In 1693 the ferriage from New York to Brooklyn\r\nwas eight stivers in wampum or a silver twopence.\" [35] As early as\r\n1652 Massachusetts had sought to supply the deficiency by the issue of\r\nshillings and sixpences. It was an affair of convenience and probably\r\nhad no political purpose. The infraction of the navigation laws was a\r\nmore serious matter. \"Ships from France, Spain, and the Canaries traded\r\ndirectly with Boston, and brought in goods which had never paid duty in\r\nany English port.\" [36] The effect of this was to excite the jealousy\r\nof the merchants in London and other English cities and to deprive\r\nMassachusetts of the sympathy of that already numerous and powerful\r\nclass of people. [Sidenote: Complaints against Massachusetts]\r\n\r\nIn 1675, the first year of King Philip\u0027s War, the British government\r\nmade up its mind to attend more closely to the affairs of its American\r\ncolonies. It had got the Dutch war off its hands, and could give heed to\r\nother things. The general supervision of the colonies was assigned to\r\na standing committee of the privy council, styled the \"Lords of the\r\nCommittee of Trade and Plantations,\" and henceforth familiarly known\r\nas the \"Lords of Trade.\" Next year the Lords of Trade sent an agent to\r\nBoston, with a letter to Governor Leverett about the Mason and Gorges\r\nclaims. Under cover of this errand the messenger was to go about and\r\nascertain the sentiments which people in the Kennebec and Piscataqua\r\ntowns, as well as in Boston, entertained for the government of\r\nMassachusetts. The person to whom this work was entrusted was Edward\r\nRandolph, a cousin of Robert Mason who inherited the property claim to\r\nthe Piscataqua county. To these men had old John Mason bequeathed his\r\ndeadly feud with Massachusetts, and the fourteen years which Randolph\r\nnow spent in New England were busily devoted to sowing the seeds of\r\nstrife. In 1678 the king appointed him collector and surveyor of customs\r\nat the port of Boston, with instructions to enforce the navigation laws.\r\nRandolph was not the man to do unpopular things in such a way as to dull\r\nthe edge of the infliction; he took delight in adding insult to injury.\r\nHe was at once harsh and treacherous. His one virtue was pecuniary\r\nintegrity; he was inaccessible to bribes and did not pick and steal from\r\nthe receipts at the custom-house. In the other relations of life he\r\nwas disencumbered of scruples. His abilities were not great, but his\r\nindustry was untiring, and he pursued his enemies with the tenacity of a\r\nsleuth-hound. As an excellent British historian observes, \"he was one of\r\nthose men who, once enlisted as partisans, lose every other feeling in\r\nthe passion which is engendered of strife.\" [37] [Sidenote: The Lords of\r\nTrade] [Sidenote: Edward Randolph]\r\n\r\nThe arrival of such a man boded no good to Massachusetts. His reception\r\nat the town-house was a cold one. Leverett liked neither his looks nor\r\nhis message, and kept his peaked hat on while he read the letter; when\r\nhe came to the signature of the king\u0027s chief secretary of state, he\r\nasked, with careless contempt, \"Who is this Henry Coventry?\" Randolph\u0027s\r\nchoking rage found vent in a letter to the king, taking pains to remind\r\nhim that the governor of Massachusetts had once been an officer in\r\nCromwell\u0027s army. As we read this and think with what ghoulish glee the\r\nwriter would have betrayed Colonel Goffe into the hands of the headsman,\r\nhad any clue been given him, we can quite understand why Hubbard and\r\nMather had nothing to say about the mysterious stranger at Hadley.\r\nEverything that Randolph could think of that would goad and irritate the\r\nking, he reported in full to London; his letters were specimens of that\r\nworst sort of lie that is based upon distorted half-truths; and his\r\nmalicious pen but seldom lay idle.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for the effects of these reports to ripen, Randolph was\r\nbusily intriguing with some of the leading men in Boston who were\r\ndissatisfied with the policy of the dominant party, and under his\r\ncareful handling a party was soon brought into existence which was ready\r\nto counsel submission to the royal will. Such was the birth of Toryism\r\nin New England. The leader of this party was Joseph Dudley, son of\r\nthe grim verse-maker who had come over as lieutenant to Winthrop. The\r\nyounger Dudley was graduated at Harvard in 1665, and proceeded to study\r\ntheology, but soon turned his attention entirely to politics. In 1673 he\r\nwas a deputy from Roxbury in the General Court; in 1675 he took part in\r\nthe storming of the Narragansett fort; in 1677 and the three following\r\nyears he was one of the Federal Commissioners. In character and temper\r\nhe differed greatly from his father. Like the proverbial minister\u0027s son\r\nwhose feet are swift toward folly, Joseph Dudley seems to have learned\r\nin stern bleak years of childhood to rebel against the Puritan theory of\r\nlife. Much of the abuse that has been heaped upon him, as a renegade and\r\ntraitor, is probably undeserved. It does not appear that he ever made\r\nany pretence of love for the Puritan commonwealth, and there were many\r\nlike him who had as lief be ruled by king as by clergy. But it cannot be\r\ndenied that his suppleness and sagacity went along with a moral nature\r\nthat was weak and vulgar. Joseph Dudley was essentially a self-seeking\r\npolitician and courtier, like his famous kinsman of the previous\r\ncentury, Robert, Earl of Leicester. His party in Massachusetts was\r\nlargely made up of men who had come to the colony for commercial\r\nreasons, and had little or no sympathy with the objects for which it was\r\nfounded. Among them were Episcopalians, Presbyterians, and Baptists, who\r\nwere allowed no chance for public worship, as well as many others who,\r\nlike Gallio, cared for none of these things. Their numbers, moreover,\r\nmust have been large, for Boston had grown to be a town of 5000\r\ninhabitants, the population of Massachusetts was approaching 30,000,\r\nand, according to Hutchinson, scarcely one grown man in five was a\r\nchurch-member qualified to vote or hold office. Such a fact speaks\r\nvolumes as to the change which was coming over the Puritan world. No\r\nwonder that the clergy had begun to preach about the weeds and tares\r\nthat were overrunning Christ\u0027s pleasant garden. No wonder that the\r\nspirit of revolt against the disfranchising policy of the theocracy was\r\nripe. [Sidenote: Joseph Dudley]\r\n\r\nIt was in 1679, when this weakness of the body politic had been duly\r\nstudied and reported by Randolph, and when all New England was groaning\r\nunder the bereavements and burdens entailed by Philip\u0027s war, that the\r\nStuart government began its final series of assaults upon Massachusetts.\r\nThe claims of the eastern proprietors, the heirs of Mason and Gorges,\r\nfurnished the occasion. Since 1643 the four Piscataqua towns--Hampton,\r\nExeter, Dover, and Portsmouth--had remained under the jurisdiction of\r\nMassachusetts. After the Restoration the Mason claim had been revived,\r\nand in 1677 was referred to the chief-justices North and Rainsford.\r\nTheir decision was that Mason\u0027s claim had always been worthless as based\r\non a grant in which the old Plymouth Company had exceeded its powers.\r\nThey also decided that Massachusetts had no valid claim since the\r\ncharter assigned her a boundary just north of the Merrimack. This\r\ndecision left the four towns subject to none but the king, who forthwith\r\nin 1679 proceeded to erect them into the royal province of New\r\nHampshire, with president and council appointed by the crown, and an\r\nassembly chosen by the people, but endowed with little authority,--a\r\ntricksome counterfeit of popular government. Within three years an\r\narrogant and thieving ruler, Edward Cranfield, had goaded New Hampshire\r\nto acts of insurrection. [Sidenote: Royal province of New Hampshire]\r\n\r\nTo the decisions of the chief-justices Massachusetts must needs submit.\r\nThe Gorges claim led to more serious results. Under Cromwell\u0027s rule in\r\n1652--the same year in which she began coining money--Massachusetts\r\nhad extended her sway over Maine. In 1665 Colonel Nichols and his\r\ncommissioners, acting upon the express instructions of Charles II.,\r\ntook it away from her. In 1668, after the commissioners had gone home,\r\nMassachusetts coolly took possession again. In 1677 the chief-justices\r\ndecided that the claim of the Gorges family, being based on a grant from\r\nJames I., was valid. Then the young Ferdinando Gorges, grandson of the\r\nfirst proprietor, offered to sell the province to the king, who had now\r\ntaken it into his head that he would like to bestow it upon the Duke\r\nof Monmouth, his favourite son by Lucy Walters. Before Charles had\r\nresponded, Governor Leverett had struck a bargain with Gorges, who ceded\r\nto Massachusetts all his rights over Maine for L1250 in hard cash. When\r\nthe king heard of this transaction he was furious. He sent a letter to\r\nBoston, commanding the General Court to surrender the province again on\r\nrepayment of this sum of L1250, and expressing his indignation that\r\nthe people should thus dare to dispose of an important claim off-hand\r\nwithout consulting his wishes. In the same letter the colony was\r\nenjoined to put in force the royal orders of seventeen years before,\r\nconcerning the oath of allegiance, the restriction of the suffrage, and\r\nthe prohibition of the Episcopal form of worship. [Sidenote: The Gorges\r\nclaim]\r\n\r\nThis peremptory message reached Boston about Christmas, 1679. Leverett,\r\nthe sturdy Ironsides, had died six months before, and his place\r\nwas filled by Simon Bradstreet, a man of moderate powers but great\r\nintegrity, and held in peculiar reverence as the last survivor of those\r\nthat had been chosen to office before leaving England by the leaders of\r\nthe great Puritan exodus. Born in a Lincolnshire village in 1603, he was\r\nnow seventy-six years old. He had taken his degree at Emmanuel College,\r\nCambridge, had served as secretary to the Earl of Warwick, and in 1629\r\nhad been appointed member of the board of assistants for the colony\r\nabout to be established on Massachusetts bay. In this position he had\r\nremained with honour for half a century, while he had also served as\r\nFederal Commissioner and as agent for the colony in London. His wife,\r\nwho died in 1672, was a woman of quaint learning and quainter verses,\r\nwhich her contemporaries admired beyond measure. One of her books was\r\nrepublished in London, with the title: \"The Tenth Muse, lately sprung up\r\nin America.\" John Norton once said that if Virgil could only have heard\r\nthe seraphic poems of Anne Bradstreet, he would have thrown his heathen\r\ndoggerel into the fire. She was sister of Joseph Dudley, and evidently\r\ninherited this rhyming talent, such as it was, from her father. Governor\r\nBradstreet belonged to the moderate party who would have been glad to\r\nextend the franchise, but he did not go with his brother-in-law in\r\nsubservience to the king. [Sidenote: Simon Bradstreet and his wife]\r\n\r\nWhen the General Court assembled, in May, 1680, the full number of\r\neighteen assistants appeared, for the first time in the history of the\r\ncolony, and in accordance with an expressed wish of the king. They\r\nwere ready to yield in trifles, but not in essentials. After wearisome\r\ndiscussion, the answer to the royal letter was decided on. It stated in\r\nvague and unsatisfactory terms that the royal orders of 1662 either had\r\nbeen carried out already or would be in good time, while to the demand\r\nfor the surrender of Maine no reply whatever was made, save that \"they\r\nwere heartily sorry that any actings of theirs should be displeasing\r\nto his Majesty.\" After this, when Randolph wrote home that the king\u0027s\r\nletters were of no more account in Massachusetts than an old London\r\nGazette, he can hardly be accused of stretching the truth. Randolph kept\r\nbusily at work, and seems to have persuaded the Bishop of London that\r\nif the charter could be annulled, episcopacy might be established in\r\nMassachusetts as in England. In February, 1682, a letter came from the\r\nking demanding submission and threatening legal proceedings against the\r\ncharter. Dudley was then sent as agent to London, and with him was sent\r\na Mr. Richards, of the extreme clerical party, to watch him. [Sidenote:\r\nMassachusetts answers the king]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the king\u0027s position at home had been changing. He had made\r\nup his mind to follow his father\u0027s example and try the experiment of\r\nsetting his people at defiance and governing without a parliament. This\r\ncould not be done without a great supply of money. Louis XIV. had\r\nplenty of money, for there was no constitution in France to prevent his\r\nsqueezing what he wanted out of the pockets of an oppressed people.\r\nFrance was thriving greatly now, for Colbert had introduced a\r\ncomparatively free system of trade between the provinces and inaugurated\r\nan era of prosperity soon to be cut short by the expulsion of the\r\nHuguenots. Louis could get money enough for the asking, and would be\r\ndelighted to foment civil disturbances in England, so as to tie the\r\nhands of the only power which at that moment could interfere with his\r\nseizing Alsace and Lorraine and invading Flanders. The pretty Louise de\r\nKeroualle Duchess of Portsmouth, with her innocent baby face and heart\r\nas cold as any reptile\u0027s, was the French Delilah chosen to shear the\r\nlocks of the British Samson. By such means and from such motives a\r\nsecret treaty was made in February, 1681, by which Louis agreed to pay\r\nCharles 2,000,000 livres down, and 500,000 more in each of the next two\r\nyears, on condition that he should summon no more parliaments within\r\nthat time. This bargain for securing the means of overthrowing the laws\r\nand liberties of England was, on the part of Charles II., an act no less\r\nreprehensible than some of those for which his father had gone to the\r\nblock. But Charles could now afford for a while to wreak his evil will.\r\nHe had already summoned a parliament for the 21st of March, to meet at\r\nOxford within the precincts of the subservient university, and out of\r\nreach of the high-spirited freemen of London. He now forced a quarrel\r\nwith the new parliament and dissolved it within a week. A joiner named\r\nStephen College, who had spoken his mind too freely in the taverns at\r\nOxford with regard to these proceedings, was drawn and quartered. The\r\nWhig leader Lord Shaftesbury was obliged to flee to Holland. In the\r\nabsence of a parliament the only power of organized resistance to the\r\nking\u0027s tyranny resided in the corporate governments of the chartered\r\ntowns. The charter of London was accordingly attacked by a writ of\r\n_quo warranto_, and in June, 1683, the time-serving judges declared it\r\nconfiscated. George Jeffreys, a low drunken fellow whom Charles had made\r\nLord Chief Justice, went on a circuit through the country; and, as Roger\r\nNorth says, \"made all the charters, like the walls of Jericho, fall down\r\nbefore him, and returned laden with surrenders, the spoils of towns.\"\r\nAt the same time a terrible blow was dealt at two of the greatest Whig\r\nfamilies in England. Lord William Russell, son of the Earl of Bedford,\r\nand Algernon Sidney, younger son of the Earl of Leicester, two of the\r\npurest patriots and ablest liberal leaders of the day, were tried on a\r\nfalse charge of treason and beheaded. [Sidenote: Secret treaty between\r\nCharles II. and Louis XIV] [Sidenote: Shameful proceedings in England]\r\n\r\nBy this quick succession of high-handed measures, the friends of law and\r\nliberty were for a moment disconcerted and paralyzed. In the frightful\r\nabasement of the courts of justice which these events so clearly showed,\r\nthe freedom of Englishmen seemed threatened in its last stronghold. The\r\ndoctrine of passive obedience to monarchs was preached in the pulpits\r\nand inculcated by the university of Oxford, which ordered the works of\r\nJohn Milton to be publicly burned. Sir Robert Filmer wrote that \"not\r\nonly in human laws, but even in divine, a thing may by the king be\r\ncommanded contrary to law, and yet obedience to such a command is\r\nnecessary.\" Charles felt so strong that in 1684 he flatly refused to\r\nsummon a parliament.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the effects of all this were felt in New England.\r\nThe mission of Dudley and his colleague was fruitless. They returned to\r\nBoston, and Randolph, who had followed them to London, now followed them\r\nback, armed with a writ of _quo warranto_ which he was instructed not to\r\nserve until he should have given Massachusetts one more chance to humble\r\nherself in the dust. Should she modify her constitution to please a\r\ntyrant or see it trampled under foot? Recent events in England served\r\nfor a solemn warning; for the moment the Tories were silenced; perhaps\r\nafter all, the absolute rule of a king was hardly to be preferred to the\r\nsway of the Puritan clergy; the day when the House of Commons sat still\r\nand wept seemed to have returned. A great town-meeting was held in the\r\nOld South Meeting-House, and the moderator requested all who were for\r\nsurrendering the charter to hold up their hands. Not a hand was lifted,\r\nand out from the throng a solitary voice exclaimed, with deep-drawn\r\nbreath, \"The Lord be praised!\" Then arose Increase Mather, president\r\nof Harvard College, and reminded them how their fathers did win this\r\ncharter, and should they deliver it up unto the spoiler who demanded it\r\n\"even as Ahab required Naboth\u0027s vineyard, Oh! their children would be\r\nbound to curse them.\" Such was the attitude of Massachusetts, and when\r\nit was known in London, the blow was struck. For technical reasons\r\nRandolph\u0027s writ was not served; but on the 21st of June a decree in\r\nchancery annulled the charter of Massachusetts. [Sidenote: Massachusetts\r\nrefuses to surrender her charter] [Sidenote: It is annulled by degree of\r\nchancery, June 21, 1684]\r\n\r\nTo appreciate the force of this blow we must pause for a moment and\r\nconsider what it involved. The right to the soil of North America had\r\nbeen hitherto regarded in England, on the strength of the discoveries of\r\nthe Cabots, as an appurtenance to the crown of Henry VII.,--as something\r\nwhich descended from father to son like the palace at Hampton Court or\r\nthe castle at Windsor, but which the sovereign might alienate by his\r\nvoluntary act just as he might sell or give away a piece of his royal\r\ndomain in England. Over this vast territory it was doubtful how far\r\nParliament was entitled to exercise authority, and the rights of\r\nEnglishmen settled there had theoretically no security save in the\r\nprovisions of the various charters by which the crown had delegated its\r\nauthority to individual proprietors or to private companies. It was thus\r\non the charter granted by Charles I. to the Company of Massachusetts Bay\r\nthat not only the cherished political and ecclesiastical institutions\r\nof the colony, but even the titles of individuals to their lands and\r\nhouses, were supposed to be founded. By the abrogation of the charter,\r\nall rights and immunities that had been based upon it were at once swept\r\naway, and every rood of the soil of Massachusetts became the personal\r\nproperty of the Stuart king, who might, if he should possess the will\r\nand the power, turn out all the present occupants or otherwise deal with\r\nthem as trespassers. Such at least was the theory of Charles II., and\r\nto show that he meant to wreak his vengeance with no gentle hand, he\r\nappointed as his viceroy the brutal Percy Kirke,--a man who would have\r\nno scruples about hanging a few citizens without trial, should occasion\r\nrequire it. [Sidenote: Effect of annulling the charter]\r\n\r\nBut in February, 1685, just as Charles seemed to be getting everything\r\narranged to his mind, a stroke of apoplexy carried him off the scene,\r\nand his brother ascended the throne. Monmouth\u0027s rebellion, and the\r\nhorrible cruelties that followed, kept Colonel Kirke busy in England\r\nthrough the summer, and left the new king scant leisure to think about\r\nAmerica. Late in the autumn, having made up his mind that he could not\r\nspare such an exemplary knave as Kirke, James II. sent over Sir Edmund\r\nAndros. In the mean time the government of Massachusetts had been\r\nadministered by Dudley, who showed himself willing to profit by the\r\nmisfortunes of his country. Andros had long been one of James\u0027s\r\nfavourites. He was the dull and dogged English officer such as one often\r\nmeets, honest enough and faithful to his master, neither cruel nor\r\nrapacious, but coarse in fibre and wanting in tact. Some years\r\nbefore, when governor of New York, he had a territorial dispute with\r\nConnecticut, and now cherished a grudge against the people of New\r\nEngland, so that, from James\u0027s point of view, he was well fitted to be\r\ntheir governor. James wished to abolish all the local governments\r\nin America, and unite them, as far as possible, under a single\r\nadministration. With Plymouth there could be no trouble; she had never\r\nhad a charter, but had existed on sufferance from the outset. In 1687\r\nthe charters of Rhode Island and Connecticut were rescinded, but the\r\ndecrees were not executed in due form. In October of that year Andros\r\nwent to Hartford, to seize the Connecticut charter but it was not\r\nsurrendered. While Sir Edmund was bandying threats with stout Robert\r\nTreat, the queller of Indians and now governor of Connecticut, in the\r\ncourse of their evening conference the candles were suddenly blown out,\r\nand when after some scraping of tinder they were lighted again the\r\ndocument was nowhere to be found, for Captain Wadsworth had carried\r\nit away and hidden it in the hollow trunk of a mighty oak tree.\r\nNevertheless for the moment the colony was obliged to submit to the\r\ntyrant. Next day the secretary John Allyn wrote \"Finis\" on the colonial\r\nrecords and shut up the book. Within another twelvemonth New York and\r\nNew Jersey were added to the viceroyalty of Andros; so that all the\r\nnorthern colonies from the forests of Maine to the Delaware river were\r\nthus brought under the arbitrary rule of one man, who was responsible to\r\nno one but the king for whatever he might take it into his head to do.\r\n[Sidenote: Sir Edmund Andros] [Sidenote: The Charter Oak]\r\n\r\nThe vexatious character of the new government was most strongly felt at\r\nBoston where Andros had his headquarters. Measures were at once taken\r\nfor the erection of an Episcopal church, and meantime the royal order\r\nwas that one of the principal meeting-houses should be seized for the\r\nuse of the Church of England. This was an ominous beginning. In the\r\neyes of the people it was much more than a mere question of disturbing\r\nPuritan prejudices. They had before them the experience of Scotland\r\nduring the past ten years, the savage times of \"Old Mortality,\" the\r\ntimes which had seen the tyrannical prelate, on the lonely moor, begging\r\nin vain for his life, the times of Drumclog and Bothwell Brigg, of\r\nClaverhouse and his flinty-hearted troopers, of helpless women tied to\r\nstakes on the Solway shore and drowned by inches in the rising tide.\r\nWhat had happened in one part of the world might happen in another, for\r\nthe Stuart policy was the same. It aimed not at securing toleration but\r\nat asserting unchecked supremacy. Its demand for an inch was the prelude\r\nto its seizing an ell, and so our forefathers understood it. Sir\r\nEdmund\u0027s formal demand for the Old South Meeting-House was flatly\r\nrefused, but on Good Friday, 1687, the sexton was frightened into\r\nopening it, and thenceforward Episcopal services were held there\r\nalternately with the regular services until the overthrow of Andros. The\r\npastor, Samuel Willard, was son of the gallant veteran who had rescued\r\nthe beleaguered people of Brookfield in King Philip\u0027s war. Amusing\r\npassages occurred between him and Sir Edmund, who relished the\r\npleasantry of keeping minister and congregation waiting an hour or\r\ntwo in the street on Sundays before yielding to them the use of their\r\nmeeting-house. More kindly memories of the unpopular governor are\r\nassociated with the building of the first King\u0027s Chapel on the spot\r\nwhere its venerable successor now stands. The church was not finished\r\nuntil after Sir Edmund had taken his departure, but Lady Andros, who\r\ndied in February, 1688, lies in the burying-ground hard by. Her gentle\r\nmanners had won all hearts. For the moment, we are told, one touch of\r\nnature made enemies kin, and as Sir Edmund walked to the townhouse\r\n\"many a head was bared to the bereaved husband that before had remained\r\nstubbornly covered to the exalted governor.\" [38] [Sidenote: Episcopal\r\nservices in Boston] [Sidenote: Founding of the King\u0027s Chapel, 1689]\r\n\r\nThe despotic rule of Andros was felt in more serious ways than in the\r\nseizing upon a meetinghouse. Arbitrary taxes were imposed, encroachments\r\nwere made upon common lands as in older manorial times, and the writ of\r\n_habeas corpus_ was suspended. Dudley was appointed censor of the press,\r\nand nothing was allowed to be printed without his permission. All the\r\npublic records of the late New England governments were ordered to be\r\nbrought to Boston, whither it thus became necessary to make a tedious\r\njourney in order to consult them. All deeds and wills were required\r\nto be registered in Boston, and excessive fees were charged for the\r\nregistry. It was proclaimed that all private titles to land were to be\r\nransacked, and that whoever wished to have his title confirmed must pay\r\na heavy quit-rent, which under the circumstances amounted to blackmail.\r\nThe General Court was abolished. The power of taxation was taken from\r\nthe town-meetings and lodged with the governor. Against this crowning\r\niniquity the town of Ipswich, led by its sturdy pastor, John Wise, made\r\nprotest. In response Mr. Wise was thrown into prison, fined £50, and\r\nsuspended from the ministry. A notable and powerful character was this\r\nJohn Wise. One of the broadest thinkers and most lucid writers of his\r\ntime, he seems like a forerunner of the liberal Unitarian divines of\r\nthe nineteenth century. His \"Vindication of the Government of the New\r\nEngland Churches,\" published in 1717, was a masterly exposition of the\r\nprinciples of civil government, and became \"a text book of liberty for\r\nour Revolutionary fathers, containing some of the notable expressions\r\nthat are used in the Declaration of Independence.\" [Sidenote: Tyranny]\r\n[Sidenote: John Wise of Ipswich]\r\n\r\nIt was on the trial of Mr. Wise in October, 1687, that Dudley openly\r\ndeclared that the people of New England had now no further privileges\r\nleft them than not to be sold for slaves. Such a state of things in the\r\nvalley of the Euphrates would not have attracted comment; the peasantry\r\nof central Europe would have endured it until better instructed; but in\r\nan English community it could not last long. If James II. had remained\r\nupon the throne, New England would surely have soon risen in rebellion\r\nagainst Andros. But the mother country had by this time come to repent\r\nthe fresh lease of life which she had granted to the Stuart dynasty\r\nafter Cromwell\u0027s death. Tired of the disgraceful subservience of her\r\nCourt to the schemes of Louis XIV., tired of fictitious plots and\r\njudicial murders, tired of bloody assizes and declarations of indulgence\r\nand all the strange devices of Stuart tyranny, England endured the\r\narrogance of James but three years, and then drove him across the\r\nChannel, to get such consolation as he might from his French paymaster\r\nand patron. On the 4th of April, 1689, the youthful John Winslow brought\r\nto Boston the news of the landing of the Prince of Orange in England.\r\nFor the space of two weeks there was quiet and earnest deliberation\r\namong the citizens, as the success of the Prince\u0027s enterprise was not\r\nyet regarded as assured. But all at once, on the morning of the 18th,\r\nthe drums beat to arms, the signal-fire was lighted on Beacon Hill, a\r\nmeeting was held at the Town-House, militia began to pour in from the\r\ncountry, and Andros, summoned to surrender, was fain to beseech Mr.\r\nWillard and the other ministers to intercede for him. But the ministers\r\nrefused. Next day the Castle was surrendered, the Rose frigate riding in\r\nthe harbour was seized and dismantled, and Andros was arrested as he was\r\ntrying to effect his escape disguised in woman\u0027s clothes. Dudley and the\r\nother agents of tyranny were also imprisoned, and thus the revolution\r\nwas accomplished. It marks the importance which the New England colonies\r\nwere beginning to attain, that, before the Prince of Orange had fully\r\nsecured the throne, he issued a letter instructing the people of Boston\r\nto preserve decorum and acquiesce yet a little longer in the government\r\nof Andros, until more satisfactory arrangements could be made. But\r\nIncrease Mather, who was then in London on a mission in behalf of New\r\nEngland, judiciously prevented this letter of instructions from being\r\nsent. The zeal of the people outstripped the cautious policy of the\r\nnew sovereign, and provisional governments, in accordance with the old\r\ncharters, were at once set up in the colonies lately ruled by Andros.\r\nBradstreet now in his eighty-seventh year was reinstated as governor of\r\nMassachusetts. Five weeks after this revolution in Boston the order to\r\nproclaim King William and Queen Mary was received, amid such rejoicings\r\nas had never before been seen in that quiet town, for it was believed\r\nthat self-government would now be guaranteed to New England. [Sidenote:\r\nFall of James II.] [Sidenote: Insurrection in Boston, and overthrow of\r\nAndros, April 18, 1689]\r\n\r\nThis hope was at least so far realized that from the most formidable\r\ndangers which had threatened it, New England was henceforth secured.\r\nThe struggle with the Stuarts was ended, and by this second revolution\r\nwithin half a century the crown had received a check from which it never\r\nrecovered. There were troubles yet in store for England, but no more\r\nsuch outrages as the judicial murders of Russell and Sidney. New England\r\nhad still a stern ordeal to go through, but never again was she to be\r\nso trodden down and insulted as in the days of Andros. The efforts of\r\nGeorge III. to rule Englishmen despotically were weak as compared with\r\nthose of the Stuarts. In his time England had waxed strong enough to\r\ncurb the tyrant, America had waxed strong enough to defy and disown him.\r\nAfter 1689 the Puritan no longer felt that his religion was in danger,\r\nand there was a reasonable prospect that charters solemnly granted him\r\nwould be held sacred. William III. was a sovereign of modern type, from\r\nwhom freedom of thought and worship had nothing to fear. In his theology\r\nhe agreed, as a Dutch Calvinist, more nearly with the Puritans than with\r\nthe Church of England. At the same time he had no great liking for so\r\nmuch independence of thought and action as New England had exhibited. In\r\nthe negotiations which now definitely settled the affairs of this part\r\nof the world, the intractable behaviour of Massachusetts was borne in\r\nmind and contrasted with the somewhat less irritating attitude of\r\nthe smaller colonies. It happened that the decree which annulled the\r\ncharters of Rhode Island and Connecticut had not yet been formally\r\nenrolled. It was accordingly treated as void, and the old charters were\r\nallowed to remain in force. They were so liberal that no change in\r\nthem was needed at the time of the Revolution, so that Connecticut was\r\ngoverned under its old charter until 1818, and Rhode Island until 1842.\r\n[Sidenote: Effects of the Revolution of 1689]\r\n\r\nThere was at this time a disposition on the part of the British\r\ngovernment to unite all the northern colonies under a single\r\nadministration. The French in Canada were fast becoming rivals to be\r\nfeared; and the wonderful explorations of La Salle, bringing the St.\r\nLawrence into political connection with the Mississippi, had at length\r\nforeshadowed a New France in the rear of all the English colonies,\r\naiming at the control of the centre of the continent and eager to\r\nconfine the English to the sea-board. Already the relations of position\r\nwhich led to the great Seven Years\u0027 War were beginning to shape\r\nthemselves; and the conflict between France and England actually broke\r\nout in 1689, as soon as Louis XIV.\u0027s hired servant, James II., was\r\nsuperseded by William III. as king of England and head of a Protestant\r\nleague. [Sidenote: Need for union among all the northern colonies]\r\n\r\nIn view of this new state of affairs, it was thought desirable to unite\r\nthe northern English colonies under one head, so far as possible, in\r\norder to secure unity of military action. But natural prejudices had to\r\nbe considered. The policy of James II. had aroused such bitter feeling\r\nin America that William must needs move with caution. Accordingly he did\r\nnot seek to unite New York with New England, and he did not think it\r\nworth while to carry out the attack which James had only begun upon\r\nConnecticut and Rhode Island. As for New Hampshire, he seems to have\r\nbeen restrained by what in the language of modern politics would be\r\ncalled \"pressure,\" brought to bear by certain local interests. [39]\r\nBut in the case of the little colony founded by the Pilgrims of the\r\nMayflower there was no obstacle. She was now annexed to Massachusetts,\r\nwhich also received not only Maine but even Acadia, just won from the\r\nFrench; so that, save for the short break at Portsmouth, the coast of\r\nMassachusetts now reached all the way from Martha\u0027s Vineyard to the Gulf\r\nof St. Lawrence. [Sidenote: Plymouth, Maine, and Acadia, annexed to\r\nMassachusetts]\r\n\r\nBut along with this great territorial extension there went some\r\ncurtailment of the political privileges of the colony. By the new\r\ncharter of 1692 the right of the people to be governed by a legislature\r\nof their own choosing was expressly confirmed. The exclusive right of\r\nthis legislature to impose taxes was also confirmed. But henceforth no\r\nqualification of church-membership, but only a property qualification,\r\nwas to be required of voters; the governor was to be appointed by the\r\ncrown instead of being elected by the people; and all laws passed by\r\nthe legislature were to be sent to England for royal approval. These\r\nfeatures of the new charter,--the extension, or if I may so call it, the\r\n_secularization_ of the franchise, the appointment of the governor\r\nby the crown, and the power of veto which the crown expressly\r\nreserved,--were grave restrictions upon the independence which\r\nMassachusetts had hitherto enjoyed. Henceforth her position was to be\r\nlike that of the other colonies with royal governors. But her history\r\ndid not thereby lose its interest or significance, though it became,\r\nlike the history of most of the colonies, a dismal record of\r\nirrepressible bickerings between the governor appointed by the crown and\r\nthe legislature elected by the people. In the period that began in 1692\r\nand ended in 1776, the movements of Massachusetts, while restricted\r\nand hampered, were at the same time forced into a wider orbit. She was\r\nbrought into political sympathy with Virginia. While two generations\r\nof men were passing across the scene, the political problems of\r\nMassachusetts were assimilated to those of Virginia. In spite of all\r\nthe other differences, great as they were, there was a likeness in the\r\nstruggles between the popular legislature and the royal governor which\r\nsubordinated them all. It was this similarity of experience, during\r\nthe eighteenth century, that brought these two foremost colonies into\r\ncordial alliance during the struggle against George III., and thus made\r\nit possible to cement all the colonies together in the mighty nation\r\nwhose very name is fraught with so high and earnest a lesson to\r\nmankind,--the UNITED STATES! [Sidenote: Massachusetts becomes a royal\r\nprovince]\r\n\r\nFor such a far-reaching result, the temporary humiliation of\r\nMassachusetts was a small price to pay. But it was not until long after\r\nthe accession of William III. that things could be seen in these grand\r\noutlines. With his coronation began the struggle of seventy years\r\nbetween France and England, far grander than the struggle between Rome\r\nand Carthage, two thousand years earlier, for primacy in the world,\r\nfor the prerogative of determining the future career of mankind. That\r\nwarfare, so fraught with meaning, was waged as much upon American as\r\nupon European ground; and while it continued, it was plainly for the\r\ninterest of the British government to pursue a conciliatory policy\r\ntoward its American colonies, for without their wholehearted assistance\r\nit could have no hope of success. As soon as the struggle was ended, and\r\nthe French power in the colonial world finally overthrown, the perpetual\r\nquarrels between the popular legislatures and the royal governors led\r\nimmediately to the Stamp Act and the other measures of the British\r\ngovernment that brought about the American revolution. People sometimes\r\nargue about that revolution as if it had no past behind it and was\r\nsimply the result of a discussion over abstract principles. [Sidenote:\r\nSeeds of the American Revolution already sown]\r\n\r\nWe can now see that while the dispute involved an abstract principle of\r\nfundamental importance to mankind, it was at the same time for Americans\r\nillustrated by memories sufficiently concrete and real. James Otis\r\nin his prime was no further distant from the tyranny of Andros than\r\nmiddle-aged men of to-day are distant from the Missouri Compromise. The\r\nsons of men cast into jail along with John Wise may have stood silent in\r\nthe moonlight on Griffin\u0027s Wharf and looked on while the contents of the\r\ntea-chests were hurled into Boston harbour. In the events we have here\r\npassed in review, it may be seen, so plainly that he who runs may read,\r\nhow the spirit of 1776 was foreshadowed in 1689.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn interesting account of the Barons\u0027 War and the meeting of the first\r\nHouse of Commons is given in Prothero\u0027s _Simon de Montfort_, London,\r\n1877. For Wyclif and the Lollards, see Milman\u0027s _Latin Christianity_,\r\nvol. vii.\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastical history of the Tudor period may best be studied in\r\nthe works of John Strype, to wit, _Historical Memorials_, 6 vols.;\r\n_Annals of the Reformation_, 7 vols.; _Lives of Cranmer, Parker,\r\nWhitgift, etc._, Oxford, 1812-28. See also _Burnet\u0027s History of the\r\nReformation of the Church of England_, 3 vols., London, 1679-1715;\r\nNeal\u0027s _History of the Puritans_, London, 1793; Tulloch, _Leaders of the\r\nReformation_, Boston, 1859. A vast mass of interesting information is\r\nto be found in _The Zurich Letters, comprising the Correspondence\r\nof Several English Bishops, and Others, with some of the Helvetian\r\nReformers_, published by the Parker Society, 4 vols., Cambridge, Eng.,\r\n1845-46. Hooker\u0027s _Ecclesiastical Polity_ was published in London, 1594;\r\na new edition, containing two additional books, the first complete\r\nedition, was published in 1622.\r\n\r\nFor the general history of England in the seventeenth century, there are\r\ntwo modern works which stand far above all others,--Gardiner\u0027s _History\r\nof England_, 10 vols., London, 1883-84; and Masson\u0027s _Life of Milton,\r\nnarrated in connection with the Political, Ecclesiastical, and Literary\r\nHistory of his Time_, 6 vols., Cambridge, Eng., 1859-80. These are\r\nbooks of truly colossal erudition, and written in a spirit of judicial\r\nfairness. Mr. Gardiner\u0027s ten volumes cover the forty years from the\r\naccession of James I. to the beginning of the Civil War, 1603-1643. Mr.\r\nGardiner has lately published the first two volumes of his history of\r\nthe Civil War, and it is to be hoped that he will not stop until he\r\nreaches the accession of William and Mary. Indeed, such books as his\r\nought never to stop. My friend and colleague, Prof. Hosmer, tells me\r\nthat Mr. Gardiner is a lineal descendant of Cromwell and Ireton. His\r\nlittle book, _The Puritan Revolution_, in the \"Epochs of History\"\r\nseries, is extremely useful, and along with it one should read Airy\u0027s\r\n_The English Restoration and Louis XIV_., in the same series, New York,\r\n1889. The best biography of Cromwell is by Mr. Allanson Picton, London,\r\n1882; see also Frederic Harrison\u0027s _Cromwell_, London, 1888, an\r\nexcellent little book. Hosmer\u0027s _Young Sir Henry Vane_, Boston, 1888,\r\nshould be read in the same connection; and one should not forget\r\nCarlyle\u0027s _Cromwell_. See also Tulloch, _English Puritanism and its\r\nLeaders_, 1861, and _Rational Theology and Christian Philosophy in\r\nEngland in the Seventeenth Century_, 1872; Skeats, _History of the\r\nFree Churches of England_, London, 1868; Mountfield, _The Church and\r\nPuritans_, London, 1881. Dexter\u0027s _Congregationalism of the Last Three\r\nHundred Years_, New York, 1880, is a work of monumental importance.\r\n\r\nOn the history of New England the best general works are Palfrey,\r\n_History of New England_, 4 vols., Boston, 1858-75; and Doyle, _The\r\nEnglish in America--The Puritan Colonies_, 2 vols., London, 1887. In\r\npoint of scholarship Dr. Palfrey\u0027s work is of the highest order, and\r\nit is written in an interesting style. Its only shortcoming is that it\r\ndeals somewhat too leniently with the faults of the Puritan theocracy,\r\nand looks at things too exclusively from a Massachusetts point of view.\r\nIt is one of the best histories yet written in America. Mr. Doyle\u0027s work\r\nis admirably fair and impartial, and is based throughout upon a careful\r\nstudy of original documents. The author is a Fellow of All Souls\r\nCollege, Oxford, and has apparently made American history his specialty.\r\nHis work on the Puritan colonies is one of a series which when completed\r\nwill cover the whole story of English colonization in America. I have\r\nlooked in vain in his pages for any remark or allusion indicating that\r\nhe has ever visited America, and am therefore inclined to think that he\r\nhas not done so. He now and then makes a slight error such as would\r\nnot be likely to be made by a native of New England, but this is very\r\nseldom. The accuracy and thoroughness of its research, its judicial\r\ntemper, and its philosophical spirit make Mr. Doyle\u0027s book in some\r\nrespects the best that has been written about New England.\r\n\r\nAmong original authorities we may begin by citing John Smith\u0027s\r\n_Description of New England_, 1616, and _New England\u0027s Trial_, 1622,\r\ncontained in Arber\u0027s new edition of Smith\u0027s works, London, 1884.\r\nBradford\u0027s narrative of the founding of Plymouth was for a long time\r\nsupposed to be lost. Nathaniel Morton\u0027s _New England\u0027s Memorial_,\r\npublished in 1669, was little more than an abridgment of it. After two\r\ncenturies Bradford\u0027s manuscript was discovered, and an excellent edition\r\nby Mr. Charles Deane was published in the _Massachusetts Historical\r\nCollections_, 4th series, vol. iii., 1856. Edward Winslow\u0027s _Journal of\r\nthe Proceedings of the English Plantation settled at Plymouth_, 1622,\r\nand _Good News from New England_, 1624, are contained, with other\r\nvaluable materials, in Young\u0027s _Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers_,\r\nBoston, 1844. See also Shurtleff and Pulsifer, _Records of Plymouth_,\r\n12 vols., ending with the annexation of the colony to Massachusetts in\r\n1692; Prince\u0027s _Chronological History of New England_, ed. Drake, 1852;\r\nand in this connection Hunter\u0027s _Founders of New Plymouth_, London,\r\n1854; Steele\u0027s _Life of Brewster_, Philadelphia, 1857; Goodwin\u0027s\r\n_Pilgrim Republic_, Boston, 1887; Bacon\u0027s _Genesis of the New England\r\nChurches_, New York, 1874; Baylies\u0027s _Historical Memoir_, 1830;\r\nThacher\u0027s _History of the Town of Plymouth_, 1832.\r\n\r\nSir Ferdinando Gorges wrote a _Briefe Narration of the Originall\r\nUndertakings of the advancement of plantations into the parts of\r\nAmerica, especially showing the beginning, progress, and continuance\r\nof that of New England_, London, 1658, contained in his grandson\u0027s\r\ncollection entitled _America Painted to the Life_. Thomas Morton, of\r\nMerrymount, gave his own view of the situation in his _New English\r\nCanaan_, which has been edited for the Prince Society, with great\r\nlearning, by C.F. Adams. Samuel Maverick also had his say in a valuable\r\npamphlet entitled _A Description of New England_, which has only come\r\nto light since 1875 and has been edited by Mr. Deane. Maverick is, of\r\ncourse, hostile to the Puritans. See also Lechford\u0027s _Plain Dealing in\r\nNew England_, ed. J.H. Trumbull, 1867.\r\n\r\nThe earliest history of Massachusetts is by Winthrop himself, a work of\r\npriceless value. In 1790, nearly a century and a half after the author\u0027s\r\ndeath, it was published at Hartford. The best edition is that of 1853.\r\nIn 1869 a valuable life of Winthrop was published by his descendant\r\nRobert Winthrop. Hubbard\u0027s _History of New England_ (_Mass. Hist.\r\nColl._, 2d series, vols. v., vi.) is drawn largely from Winthrop and\r\nfrom Nathaniel Morton. There is much that is suggestive in William\r\nWood\u0027s _New England\u0027s Prospect_, 1634, and Edward Johnson\u0027s\r\n_Wonder-working Providence of Zion\u0027s Saviour in New England_, 1654; the\r\nlatter has been ably edited by W.F. Poole, Andover, 1867. The records\r\nof the Massachusetts government, from its founding in 1629 down to the\r\noverthrow of the charter in 1684, were edited by Dr. Shurtleff in 6\r\nvols. quarto, 1853-54; and among the documents in the British Record\r\nOffice, published since 1855, three volumes--_Calendar of State Papers_,\r\n_Colonial America_, vol. i., 1574-1660; vol. v., 1661-1668; vol. vii.,\r\n1669--are especially useful. Of the later authorities the best is\r\nHutchinson\u0027s _History of Massachusetts Bay_, the first volume of which,\r\ncoming down to 1689, was published in Boston in 1764. The second volume,\r\ncontinuing the narrative to 1749, was published in 1767. The third\r\nvolume, coming down to 1774, was found among the illustrious author\u0027s\r\nMSS. after his death, and was published in London in 1828. Hutchinson\r\nhad access to many valuable documents since lost, and his sound judgment\r\nand critical acumen deserve the highest praise. In 1769 he published\r\na volume of _Original Papers_, illustrating the period covered by the\r\nfirst volume of his history. Many priceless documents perished in the\r\nshameful sacking of his house by the Boston rioters, Aug. 26, 1765. The\r\nsecond volume of Hutchinson\u0027s _History_ was continued to 1764 by G.R.\r\nMinot, 2 vols., 1798, and to 1820 by Alden Bradford, 3 vols., 1822-29.\r\nOf recent works, the best is Barry\u0027s _History of Massachusetts_, 3\r\nvols., 1855-57. Many original authorities are collected in Young\u0027s\r\n_Chronicles of Massachusetts_, Boston, 1846. Cotton Mather\u0027s _Magnolia\r\nChristi Americana_, London, 1702 (reprinted in 1820 and 1853), though\r\ncrude and uncritical, is full of interest.\r\n\r\nMany of the early Massachusetts documents relate to Maine. Of later\r\nbooks, especial mention should be made of Folsom\u0027s _History of Saco and\r\nBiddeford_, Saco, 1830; Willis\u0027s _History of Portland_, 2 vols., 1831-33\r\n(2d ed. 1865); _Memorial Volume of the Popham Celebration_, Portland,\r\n1862; Chamberlain\u0027s _Maine, Her Place in History_, Augusta, 1877. On New\r\nHampshire the best general work is Belknap\u0027s _History of New Hampshire_,\r\n3 vols., Phila., 1784-92; the appendix contains many original\r\ndocuments, and others are to be found in the _New Hampshire Historical\r\nCollections_, 8 vols., 1824-66.\r\n\r\nThe _Connecticut Colonial Records_ are edited by Dr. J.H. Trumbull,\r\n12 vols., 1850-82. The _Connecticut Historical Society\u0027s Collections_,\r\n1860-70, are of much value. The best general work is Trumbull\u0027s _History\r\nof Connecticut_, 2 vols., Hartford, 1797. See also Stiles\u0027s _Ancient\r\nWindsor_, 2 vols., 1859-63; Cothren\u0027s _Ancient Woodbury_, 3 vols.,\r\n1854-79. Of the Pequot War we have accounts by three of the principal\r\nactors. Mason\u0027s _History of the Pequod War_ is in the _Mass. Hist.\r\nColl._, 2d series, vol. viii.; Underhill\u0027s _News from America_ is in the\r\n3d series, vol. vi.; and Lyon Gardiner\u0027s narrative is in the 3d series,\r\nvol. iii. In the same volume with Underhill is contained _A True\r\nRelation of the late Battle fought in New England between the English\r\nand the Pequod Savages_, by Philip Vincent, London, 1638. The _New Haven\r\nColony Records_ are edited by C.J. Hoadly, 2 vols., Hartford, 1857-58.\r\nSee also the _New Haven Historical Society\u0027s Papers_, 3 vols., 1865-80;\r\nLambert\u0027s _History of New Haven_, 1838; Atwater\u0027s _History of New\r\nHaven_, 1881; Levermore\u0027s _Republic of New Haven_, Baltimore, 1886;\r\nJohnston\u0027s _Connecticut_, Boston, 1887. The best account of the Blue\r\nLaws is by J.H. Trumbull, _The True Blue Laws of Connecticut and New\r\nHaven, and the False Blue Laws invented by the Rev. Samuel Peters_,\r\netc., Hartford, 1876. See also Hinman\u0027s _Blue Laws of New Haven Colony_,\r\nHartford, 1838; Barber\u0027s _History and Antiquities of New Haven_, 1831;\r\nPeters\u0027s _History of Connecticut_, London, 1781. The story of the\r\nregicides is set forth in Stiles\u0027s _History of the Three Judges_ [the\r\nthird being Colonel Dixwell], Hartford, 1794; see also the _Mather\r\nPapers_ in _Mass. Hist. Coll._, 4th series, vol. viii.\r\n\r\n_The Rhode Island Colonial Records_ are edited by J.R. Bartlett, 7\r\nvols., 1856-62. One of the best state histories ever written is that\r\nof S.G. Arnold, _History of the State of Rhode Island and Providence\r\nPlantations_, 2 vols., New York, 1859-60. Many valuable documents are\r\nreprinted in the _Rhode Island Historical Society\u0027s Collections_. The\r\n_History of New England, with particular reference to the denomination\r\ncalled Baptists_, by Rev. Isaac Backus, 3 vols., 1777-96, has much\r\nthat is valuable relating to Rhode Island. The series of _Rhode Island\r\nHistorical Tracts_, issued since 1878 by Mr. S.S. Rider, is of great\r\nmerit. Biographies of Roger Williams have been written by J.D. Knowles,\r\n1834; by William Gammell, 1845; and by Romeo Elton, 1852. Williams\u0027s\r\nworks have been republished by the Narragansett Club in 6 vols., 1866.\r\nThe first volume contains the valuable _Key to the Indian Languages of\r\nAmerica_, edited by Dr. Trumbull. Williams\u0027s views of religious liberty\r\nare set forth in his _Bloudy Tenent of Persecution_, London, 1644; to\r\nwhich John Cotton replied in _The Bloudy Tenent washed and made White in\r\nthe Blood of the Lamb_, London, 1647; Williams\u0027s rejoinder was entitled\r\n_The Bloudy Tenent made yet more Bloudy through Mr. Cotton\u0027s attempt\r\nto Wash it White_, London, 1652. The controversy was conducted on both\r\nsides with a candour and courtesy rare in that age. The titles of\r\nWilliams\u0027s other principal works, _George Fox digged out of his\r\nBurrowes_, Boston, 1676; _Hireling Ministry none of Christ\u0027s_, London,\r\n1652; and _Christenings make not Christians_, 1643; sufficiently\r\nindicate their character. The last-named tract was discovered in the\r\nBritish Museum by Dr. Dexter and edited by him in Rider\u0027s _Tracts_,\r\nNo. xiv., 1881. The treatment of Roger Williams by the government\r\nof Massachusetts is thoroughly discussed in Dexter\u0027s _As to Roger\r\nWilliams_, Boston, 1876. See also G.E. Ellis on \"The Treatment of\r\nIntruders and Dissentients by the Founders of Massachusetts,\" in _Lowell\r\nLectures_, Boston, 1869.\r\n\r\nThe case of Mrs. Hutchinson is treated, from a hostile and somewhat\r\ntruculent point of view, in Thomas Welde\u0027s pamphlet entitled _A Short\r\nStory of the Rise, Reign, and Ruin of Antinomians, Familists, and\r\nLibertines that infected the Churches of New England_, London, 1644. It\r\nwas answered in an anonymous pamphlet entitled _Mercurius Americanus_,\r\nrepublished for the Prince Society, Boston, 1876, with prefatory notice\r\nby C.H. Bell. Cotton\u0027s view of the theocracy may be seen in his _Milk\r\nfor Babes, drawn out of the Breasts of both Testaments_, London, 1646;\r\n_Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven_; and _Way of the Congregational\r\nChurches Cleared_, London, 1648. See also Thomas Hooker\u0027s _Survey of the\r\nSumme of Church Discipline_, London, 1648. The intolerant spirit of the\r\ntime finds quaint and forcible expression in Nathaniel Ward\u0027s satirical\r\nbook, _The Simple Cobbler of Aggawam_, 1647.\r\n\r\nFor the Gorton controversy the best original authorities are his own\r\nbook entitled _Simplicitie\u0027s Defence against Sevenheaded Polity_,\r\nLondon, 1646; and Winslow\u0027s answer entitled _Hypocracie Unmasked_,\r\nLondon, 1646. See also Mackie\u0027s _Life of Samuel Gorton_, Boston, 1845,\r\nand Brayton\u0027s _Defence of Samuel Gorton_, in Rider\u0027s _Tracts_, No. xvii.\r\n\r\nFor the early history of the Quakers, see Robert Barclay\u0027s _Inner Life\r\nof the Religious Societies of the Commonwealth_, London, 1876,--an\r\nadmirable book.

The\r\nlast was Sedgmoor in 1685. For four centuries, since Bosworth, in 1485,\r\nthe English people have lived in peace in their own homes, except for\r\nthe brief episode of the Great Rebellion, and Monmouth\u0027s slight affair.\r\nThis long peace, unparalleled in history, has powerfully influenced the\r\nEnglish and American character for good. Since the Middle Ages most\r\nEnglish warfare has been warfare at a distance, and that does not\r\nnourish the brutal passions in the way that warfare at home does.\r\nAn instructive result is to be seen in the mildness of temper which\r\ncharacterized the conduct of our stupendous Civil War. Nothing like it\r\nwas ever seen before.\r\n\r\n[7] Picton\u0027s _Cromwell_, pp. 61, 67; Gardiner, _Puritan Revolution_, p.\r\n72.\r\n\r\n[8] Quincy, History of Harvard University, ii. 654.\r\n\r\n[9] C.F.

He died in 1677 at a great age. In 1771 Dr. Ezra\r\nStiles visited, in Providence, his last surviving disciple, born in\r\n1691. This old man said that Gorton wrote in heaven, and none can\r\nunderstand his books except those who live in heaven while on earth.\r\n\r\n[22] Doyle, _Puritan Colonies_,: i. 369.\r\n\r\n[23] Doyle, i.: 372.\r\n\r\n[24] Milman, _Latin Christianity_, vii. 390.\r\n\r\n[25] Doyle, ii. 133, 134; Rhode Island Records, i. 377, 378.\r\n\r\n[26] Colonial Laws of Massachusetts, pp. 14-16; Levermore\u0027s Republic of\r\nNew Haven, p. 153.\r\n\r\n[27] See my remarks above, p. 145.\r\n\r\n[28] The daring passage in the sermon is thus given in Bacon\u0027s\r\n_Historical Discourses_, New Haven, 1838: \"Withhold not countenance,\r\nentertainment, and protection from the people of God--whom men may call\r\nfools and fanatics--if any such come to you from other countries,\r\nas from France or England, or any other place. Be not forgetful to\r\nentertain strangers. Remember those that are in bonds, as bound with\r\nthem. The Lord required this of Moab, saying, \u0027Make thy shadow as the\r\nnight in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him\r\nthat wandereth. Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a\r\ncovert to them from the face of the spoiler.\u0027 Is it objected--\u0027But so I\r\nmay expose myself to be spoiled or troubled\u0027? He, therefore, to remove\r\nthis objection, addeth, \u0027For the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler\r\nceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.\u0027 While we are\r\nattending to our duty in owning and harbouring Christ\u0027s witnesses, God\r\nwill be providing for their and our safety, by destroying those that\r\nwould destroy his people.\"\r\n\r\n[29] Palfrey, _History of New England,_ in. 138-140.\r\n\r\n[30] See Parkman, _Conspiracy of Pontiac_, i. 80-85.\r\n\r\n[31] De Forest, _History of the Indians of Connecticut,_ pp. 252, 257.\r\n\r\n[32] The story rests chiefly upon the statements of Hutchinson, an\r\nextremely careful and judicious writer, and not in the least what\r\nthe French call a _gobemouche_. Goffe kept a diary which came into\r\nHutchinson\u0027s possession, and was one of the priceless manuscripts that\r\nperished in the infamous sacking of his house by the Boston mob of\r\nAugust 26, 1765. What light that diary might have thrown upon the matter\r\ncan never be known. Hutchinson was born in 1711, only thirty-six years\r\nafter the event, so that his testimony is not so very far removed from\r\nthat of a contemporary. Whalley seems to have died in Hadley shortly\r\nbefore 1675, and Goffe deemed it prudent to leave that neighbourhood in\r\n1676. His letters to Increase Mather are dated from \"Ebenezer,\" i. e.,\r\nwherever in his roamings he set up his Ebenezer. One of these letters,\r\ndated September 8, 1676, shows that his Ebenezer was then set up in\r\nHartford, where probably he died about 1679 In 1676 the arrival of\r\nEdward Randolph (see below, p. 256) renewed the peril of the regicide\r\njudge, and his sudden removal from his skilfully contrived hiding-place\r\nat Hadley might possibly have been due to his having exposed himself\r\nto recognition in the Indian fight. Possibly even the supernatural\r\nexplanation might have been started, with a touch of Yankee humour, as\r\na blind. The silence of Mather and Hubbard was no more remarkable than\r\nsome of the other ingenious incidents which had so long served to\r\nconceal the existence of this sturdy and crafty man. The reasons for\r\ndoubting the story are best stated by Mr. George Sheldon of Deerfield,\r\nin _Hist.-Genealogical Register_, October, 1874.\r\n\r\n[33] If Philip was half the diplomatist that he is represented in\r\ntradition, he never would have gone into such a war without assurance of\r\nNarragansett help. Canonchet was a far more powerful sachem than Philip,\r\nand played a more conspicuous part in the war. May we not suppose that\r\nCanonchet\u0027s desire to avenge his father\u0027s death was one of the principal\r\nincentives to the war; that Philip\u0027s attack upon Swanzey was a premature\r\nexplosion; and that Canonchet then watched the course of events for a\r\nwhile before making up his mind whether to abandon Philip or support\r\nhim?\r\n\r\n[34] A wretched little werewolf who some few years ago, being then a lad\r\nof fourteen or fifteen years, most cruelly murdered two or three\r\nyoung children, just to amuse himself with their dying agonies. The\r\nmisdirected \"humanitarianism,\" which in our country makes every murderer\r\nan object of popular sympathy, prevailed to save this creature from\r\nthe gallows. Massachusetts has lately witnessed a similar instance of\r\nmisplaced clemency in the case of a vile woman who had poisoned eight or\r\nten persons, including some of her own children, in order to profit\r\nby their life insurance. Such instances help to explain the prolonged\r\nvitality of \"Judge Lynch,\" and sometimes almost make one regret the days\r\nin old England when William Probert, after escaping in 1824 as \"king\u0027s\r\nevidence,\" from the Thurtell affair, got caught and hanged within a\r\ntwelvemonth for horse-stealing.
